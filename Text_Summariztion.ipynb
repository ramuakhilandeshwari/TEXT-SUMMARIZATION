            "Who would pay 30000 for an underpowered piece of junk  Sure theyre pretty but where does the 30000 come into place  You can get a BMW for the price of a Mustang  Come on people stop wasting your money  We had the car for a month or so until we noticed the ground effects in the front were warped We were told by Ford that we could either leave it alone or have them replace itI elected to leave it alone Overall we were impressed with the acceleration and amenities of the car along with the build quality of the somewhat dated interior We were happy with the looks of the car and the Mach 460 sound system whether the top was up or down  Bought this car clobbered was hit in side and warped like a banana So I bought another cut them in half and put them together quite a job but the car is one of the most fun to drive cars Ive owned love the drop top decent power But sad to say I must sell her I need the down payment for my 2003 cobra convt Rock On FORD  Keep bangin them out  Mustang is fun Negative these huge airscoops  would like to get rid of that but its standard Ford should give their customers the choice if they want that Some minor quality issues  squeeking noise in dashboard rear seat with small gap in cloth  fix under warranty Rear solid axle is from the museum  but with US speeds certainly acceptable would not try that on high speed European roads Net  a fun car with acceptable negatives  we like to dirve and wait for sun GREAT LOOKING CAR QUALITY IS SOSO  Car has been fun to drive and is generally dependable  Have driven Hondas for the past 10 years prior to this purchase and noticed a significant number of quality issues with the Mustang  Little squeaks rattles and general small parts falling off or out of the vehicle  Dealer calls it normal wear and tear  I bought it in September of 2001 and it has already been in the shop 5 times I noticed that there was a rip in the back seat The car had a bad sincer within the 2nd month When I am rolling the window down or up there is this very LOUD squeeking noise I can not take it through a touchless car wash because it leaks If that is the case then Ford should have their sales people explain that to the buyer before purchasing the car  Funest car I have ever driven  Good power while still posessing much comfort and refinement  Awesome Car  I bought the Mustang GT Vert for one reason to have fun on those summer daysnights For performance it doesnt pull like a V8  all Its missing a little grunt For a 260HP3800Lbs ratio I really did not expect for this car to fly Interior design is superb especially that I got the tan leater interior I really dont like the fact that Ford had to place the shifter so far An 18 wheeler trucks shifter is much closer Exterior designIt takes time before you get used to it Hate those antennas For a car under 30K I would recommend the Mustang GT NOTHING ELSE  Retro in style in handling and in functionality Nothing too hitech better than average sound system soso power no its not a 390 or 460 Ford but it can also pass the gas station without stopping for a drink Sitting in the drivers seat reminds me of the view of my old 58 Tbird dual cockpit hood scoop The rides nice the 5speed has a longer throw than I like but then again Im not going to power shift at my age  The rear seat  is nonfunctional I dont have kidsgrand kids to worry about  As far as Im concerned its an extension of the trunk The car is primarily a 2seat sports vehicle thatÂ’s more functional than an old MG and maybe a lot more reliable  tHIS IS MY 3RD MUSTANG THE BEST ONE SO FAR GOT TRIPLE BLACK CONVERTIBLE A GREAT CAR FOR A GREAT PRICE  POOR BUILD QUALITY  So far out of many vehicles this is the best  This is not a car for the shyit gets looks ever where it goes It doesnt matter what age or what car they may be drivingjust two days ago it got looks from an Fbody driver  It is a blast to drive and comfortable to ride in  I havent had one problem with it so far  The interior has a little to much plastic for me but I like the set up  The exterior in my opinion is much more agressive than the previous body style  All in all I love this car  this is the best car i have ever owned  I have never owned a better car in my life OK sure Im a little Mustang bias since my last car was also a 1991 Mustang but I wouldnt keep buying the same car if it wasnt satisfying me The ride is smooth The power is supreme The look is dashing What more could you want first ford i ever bought i bought the conv v6 with every option at 27000 miles the transmisson failedthe door bolts on the hinge fell outthe valves rattaled all the time ford really let me down with the quality of this cari will not buy a ford again  Im 47 and just bought this car for some driving fun It hasnt disappointed The 5speed shifts very smoothly  The engine growl is very pleasing from the inside cabin even though it could be a bit louder from the outside dual exhaust The Mach 1000 stereo is awesome  The ride even though stiff doesnt bother me I knew before buying the car that everything would not be perfect but what is In my opinion the car rides great sounds agressive enough has plenty of power for my driving habits and is exciting to drive  My Ford Mustang is the most enjoyable car I have ever owned and it is practical too  Reliably built a heavy muscle car lots of pickup and a real head turner  Fully loaded it was a great deal and continues to hold its value  I have babied the car in the garage all the time washed every 2 weeks and waxed quarterlypristine  I am finally a mustang owner The 2002   Coveting for 3 decades can lead to one heck of a fall This ragtop GT has satisfied my every childhood and adult expectation unwaveringly The car came out of the factory problem free as specced Not a single problem has arisen in 6 fine months of ownership Worried about reliability Forget it My 89 LX 50 has 149k and is STILL kicking fast fast fast Fit and finish are excellent as are the price peformance steering braking and handling You want upscale luxury and similar features Thats your problem Ill take this Ford and retire younger Live below your means folks The real fun is behind that chromed galloping pony  I am one of those poor bastards having to commute 50 miles up and down every day What better way than to do it in a Mustang convertible It sounds great both with the top up and down not in the least because of the great Mach sound system My wife loves it too especially when she straps the kiddy seats in the back they actually fit and the girls sit there with the top down trying to keep the long hair out of their faces You should hear them screaming Yahoo every time she pulls up from a traffic light  My whole life from the time i was 8 I wanted a Firebird I wouldnt even consider a Ford Then my friend let me drive his V6 stang and i was like hmm So i test drove a gt and i couldnt believe it This is the greatest car id ever driven And fuel economy is great compared to the Jeeps and trucks im used to driving I say buy a mustang and buy one now  This has been a great car for the two   After owning a True Blue  Graphite interior convertible for 6 months we havent had any problems or trips to the dealer for repairs  Performance could be better especially since other brands are getting over 250HP from smaller V6 motors my 11yearold Accord is faster  However since this is a relatively economical model we dont expect as much  We just drove 800 miles on a recent trip and it ran smooth and strong on the freeway  It was really great winding through wine country in central CA with the top down warm sun beautiful ride  This has been the best new car I have ever owned  Style good fuel miles sounds great not like an electric razor  For a performance car it has a great ride and is comfortable Standard features are very good  Loads of aftermarket parts to upgrade  With age the Mustang only gets better Thanks Ford  This is my third mustang  I went from the standard v6 coupe to the v6 coupe premium convertible to the now v8 premium convertiblewhich is no other way to describe than Simply Amazing  The v6 is goodbut once you drive the amazing v8 you will not settle for anything less  If you can afford the extra cash I highly suggest opting for the more agressive v8  Overall a very fun car  Jet black wblack interior looks sharp  Handles great love the way it corners  The V6 is pretty good and given the cost of insurance for the V8 its very acceptable  The MACH sound system is fantastic  Have had only a few problems with the   Have had only a few problems with the   I think it is a great car I feel like driving it more than even my favorite car the corvetteit has filled my every need and more and for less than 25000 I dont think u can get a better deal off the list of most affordable convertibles there is no car faster or better than the mustang  Great overall car You get a great looking car tire smoking power all the options plus more and a convertible for a great price Wish they changed the interior a bit more from the previous 9498 Stangs to give it that new feeling but all the controls are easy to use and access so its not too big of a deal The new exterior took a bit of getting used to when they first came out but I love it now You definetly get a lot of looks and nice comments Also handles good and fuel economy is what you would expect from a V8 sports car  We recently purchased a 1998 GT manual   Styling has great appeal Great   First of all I really got a great deal on my new Mustang and highly reccomend Traedwell Ford of Mobile AL Went back to the Mustang GT after a few years off and it as sweet as I remember it I could do without the caution tags on the visor that will not seem to come off Also the stereo buttons placement on the stereo make it very hard to see the stereo display when you are making adjustments I hate the seatbelt warning sound when you are not wearing your belt and that the seat will not lay back Please remember that the good over lap the bad by far but just some things to consider before you buy  Love the exhaust sound and there is nothing like the wind blowing through your hair in a convertible  It turns alot of heads and I get a lot of positive comments from people  Gas mileage is excellent near 28 mpg on the highway Small issue with drivers side window that I need to get fixed but otherwise a very fun car  This is the first car that I have bought and am more or less satisfied with what I have gotten I think the exterior design is great and has not looked this good in years On the other hand the interior design is horrible and needs significant improvements and more aminities  Trust meDo NOT buy this car I purchased this car used with 89k At 100k I had to replace the engine  Two months later I began having major transmission problems Buying this vehicle was the WORST financial mistake I have EVER made I sent it away to an auction two days ago so buyers BEWARE  The ford mustang is my first car and i needed to have it because i was brought up with one My mom had an 82 mustang it lasted 17 years before it bit the big one The GT mustang is great I only have one problem i think that the interior design could be a little better But otherwise its the best car i have ever seen and i love cars You should really get one there great  My wife and I have enjoyed playing arround in our new sports car My mom says I act and even look ten years younger The performance of this car can not compare to that of the 60s and 70s but it sure handles better  I was looking for a weekend toy really an excuse to buy a 3rd vehicle  With the SUVs in the driveway we wanted something a little more fun to drive We priced and test drove the European convertibles such as BMW VolvoSaab and Mercedes  Dealers are pretty proud of these cars in Houston TX Just couldnt convince myself that these cars were worth 4555K  It hit me why not a Mustang GT convertible  Test drove a GT coupe that afternoon  no convertibles in stock  and was hooked  Convertibles came in next week and took one home with us  Sweet car and half the price of the Euro boys  Tis my fourth Mustang convertible and   After owning this for two and a half years I still find myself excited to drive my Mustang  It is a great car to cruise in or to take to the track  It is an absolute joy to own  had 2 other new stangsmach tapecd   Most fun car I have ever owned Looks greatruns great gotten tons of compliments on how good it looks  I bought this car used with 3200 miles on it  Saved about 5k over a new one  The car has been ok since Ive owned it I have a couple problems with it though  First is the throwout bearing noise which Ford refuses to admit to hearing  Second is a rear chassis squeak that they of course cannot hear neither  I rarely drive the car now so these nuances are not that big of a deal  I just installed Steeda Sport Springs and I cant believe the improvement  Ford should have put these on from the start Otherwise I love the exhaust note and the power  I bought my 2000 V6 Mustang new since then I have had nothing but problemsAC went out the second time I used it the power driver seat had to be replaced 3 times the engine valves rattle the convertible top had to be replaced after 6 months because it was splitting at the seams the CD player had to be replaced twice  I could go on and on but way waste my time  In closing the car is for sale now and I will NEVER by a FORD product again  Trust me everyone if you have the chance I strongly suggest you get you hands on one  I love this car I was origiannlay looking for a Pointiac trans Am but after driving this car I fell in love right away  The exhaust note is awesome and I really like it driving through tunnels or under over passes and giving it lots of gas  This is the best car ive ever driven it is stylish and great to drivei love my mustang  Mustangs are the most comfortable cars   Great car if you can afford the insurance and dont have children  Not a lot of room to haul anything so dont plan any trips with more than two lightly packing adults  I think this drop top is a great bang for the buck It has aggressive and beautiful styling and will give you the power you want I love the shifter But the cupholders are too close to it Someone in the ford company messed up here When you shift to 2nd or 4th you always hit it cup leading the contents to conveiniently spill all over But i find the interior to be comforting it flows away from you leaving the feeling you have more space This car will make you crave what the 8 has in store The leg room is no problem but dont place to be bringing anyone around in the back seat comfortably but then again this is not to be mistaken with a minivan  I bought this car for my wife in 2000 The next day went out and put 2 stage flows on it to make it rumble  It guzzles gas is a little sluggish on the bottom but once it gets going it is fairly fast  My Ford F150 has more torque and is quicker off the bottom Overall it is fun to drive but is very loud ragtopand the tranny has already gone out Thank god it was under warranty  It has been a fun car but it rattles a lot and feels loose with only 27000 miles I wont buy another one  My first car in 1979 was a 65 Mustang coupe my dad sold to the little old lady that I purchased it from new  I debated on whether or not to spend my money on vintage or new but not for long once I drove the new  This car is pure joy to drive around town and on the open road Go 5 speed I live in city and its no big deal  Only use 1st occassionally normally starting in second try it  Overall its a very fun car to drive on smooth twisty roads with the top down  Throw in the Mach stereo system and a lot of fun can be had  To get the most fun out of this car it needs to be pushed high revs and twisty bits of pavement will plaster a smile to your face  As far as practicality is concerned this car leaves a bit to be desired  The trunk is small and the back seat is barely usable  Get this car off of smooth surfaces and squeaks and rattles abound  The FE isnt too bad for a V8  If youre looking for a fun RWD convertible that has great looks a decent interior a great sound system youll probably be satisfied with this vehicle  I love everything about my car  It is thrilling to ride in it with my convertible down I am a true convertible lover  My favorite view of my car is when I am looking at the rear lights especially at night matched with the light on my aftermarket rollbar It is absolutely adorable  I love vrooming around in it and hearing the engine  It really turns heads and the leather interior is very comfortable There are many mustang pony markings on my car  I like running my hand over the rised pony in the center of my steering wheel  If I could do it again would I still buy a mustang convertible  In a heartbeat  Interior needs update is oldfashioned looking  Gauge layout is blah  Seats have no lateral support  When buying a used car or any car some people get good ones some get bad  I know several people who are happy with their mustang v6 and dont have any problems  I however had problems  The exhaust manifolds went bad twice but were covered under warranty  After the warranty expired at about 45000 miles the transmission started slipping when you tried to accelerate hard and the valves started to make noise  The dealership told me that the valve problem is common with the V6  It cost around 500 to fix The top did make some noise around 48000 miles but it was an easy fix  I get lots of looks and comments at stop lights  Nice acceleration Incredible sound system  Not too bad gas mileage all things considered  My mineral grey with black convertible top and black leather interior stang looks great  My main complaint is that on 3 separate occasions the gas flow to the engine shut off when I was decelerating with the clutch pushed in  probably a computer chip problem that can be fixed by the dealer at nocost to me  I plan to keep this car forever although I will likely be buying a 4wheel drive Escape for winter driving  Over the years I have owned the following Mustangs 1966 2892 bbl conv 1969 351W4bbl Mach I and 1973 351C2bbl conv  Of all the Mustangs the 1999 GT conv is the best  A splenid combination of historical Mustang styling and modern technology this automobile is truly a delight to own and drive  Additionally dealer service and warranty work is absolutely flawless  Everyone should own one of these  I have owned my Mustang convertible for two and a half troublefree years This is a well made car for its level of vehicle  I owned Cadillacs previously and while this isnt a Caddy it is exactly what I wanteda fun convertible with lots of power  I have found the Ford brand to be high quality and the dealership to be very good Would highly recommend this car  Great car to drive during the   I am 23 and within reason this is definitely my DREAM car I love the fact that I see all kinds of different people driving around in a Mustang frat boys hot college chicks moms dads even the occasional Senior This car is fun fast and definitely an attention getter I considered the GT but decided the V6 was plenty of power and was told by a few other people that the little extra power you get is not worth the BIG insurance increase and frequent stops at the gas station If you like to live life with the top down this car will make you happy every day  It is the best car money can buy  fun to own and drive  I got my GT as a graduation present and I love it It is by far the best car that can be purchased for the money The steering and braking are superb looks unique and stylish and is very user friendly as a daily driver I put a lot of miles on m GT because I commute a lot and so far it has been very reliable  I BOUGHT MY CAR NEW AND AFTER I GOTDUST  This is my first convertible and I love it  It has plenty of power for me and is a real head turner especially with the top down  I love its sporty and sexy style    Mustangs are the best cars ever made  I love all convertibles but nothing carries the pizzaz of a Stang Convertible  Ours is a Redfire Metallic with two tone leather interior  Big V8 with a savvy 5 speed transmission  Plenty of power but more importantly its distinctly American and a hoot to drive  At the Sonic everybody and I mean everybody looks at this car not the other so called convertibles Stangs rule  excellent fun to drive fast the only complaint is small gas tank  This car is fast and fun  If I had to choose one sports car this would be what I would choose Im glad I own a Mustang because as a little girl I wanted a sporty car but one that was fun to drive With the Mustang you get both  I am a mother of 3 children We are   Great car especially when you live in Southern California and drive with the top down most of the year  Love the way it handles although I wish the GT suspension wasnt as hard ridingespecially over country roads  Some minor rattles but this is a convertible  A real plus is that the V8 engine uses regular fuel  That is a big savings just in itself Would definitely buy another down the road    I LOVE IT LOTZ   I love this Car it Has everything you   This is a fun car to drive Performance is superior Reliability has been great I actually own a 1998 Mustang GT convertible with 51000 miles so I know of what I speak Very comfortable for a sports car I still get lots of stares and thumbs up when I drive  Fun car to drive  the engine sounds   I just bought this car and I couldnt be happier I had a 2003 Matrix and it had no power now I know what its like to have a real car   Overall this is a great car but I would recomend having another car for the winter The car has an extremely responsive throttle making the car very quick There are many affordable aftermarket upgrades for this car My catalytic converters became stopped up And Ive heard other other mustangs having the same problem Othe than that I havent had anyproblems with the car If you buy a sports car that has a v8 engine you shouldnt expect to get great gas mileage I got about 14 miles in the city and 18 on the highway220 but I was accelerating a lot so if you dry the car easier you could probally get about 250 miles on a full tank     I purchased the Mustang convertible with the pony package GT hood scoop GT wheels and ponies running down the side at bottom of doors in silver with dark charcoal interior  It is a beautiful car I get lots of looks from people on the road  It handles very well is quick and peppy I would definitely reccomend the 5 speed manual transmission in a 6 cylinder      This car is my 3rd Mustang I havent found another car as fun to drive as this one in this price range Its got the sport the muscle the look and the looks I get while driving it are worth every pennygood and bad and with all of these great qualities it also has class A little difficult to achieve so many different characteristics in just one vehiclewell Ford has managed to produce one This car is loads of fun to drive and the most reliable  I love the look style and sound of my yellow mustang convertible  I find it a pleasure to drive  Fun car to drive  No major problems  After buying this car I joined a Mustang Club and proceeded to make modification upon advice of other members  My car stays garaged more of the time than not due to Car Show reasons Seldom driven in the rain Modified Exhasut System FlowMasters Bassanni XPipe 35 inch tips Underdrive Pulleys KN Airfilter Diablo SuperChip 9MM SVO Racing Wires Racing SplitFire Spark Plugs Steeda TriAx Shifter etc  Love My Stang I love my new car it is everything I   Fun to drive great sound perky performance  in the breeze option make this a great car a great rendition of this icon  With a few performance modifications improved suspension and better than OEM tires make this Convertible GT the car to own drive  I could not be happier with it Negatives lacks headroom when the top is on the neck support on the front seats are poorly designed and the car lacks cargo space Biggest positive the high performance dressup and aftermarket resources to personalize this car are ENDLESS   We love everything about our mustang It handles great and is lots of fun   This mustang is awesome the convertible except it has very slow pickup rates  I seem to have to floor it for a few seconds before it even starts going fast  It is a little disappointing  Heres a tiptry not to use the air conditioning because it drains the gas and lowers performance  I love this car  I think the   Ive only had the car for about 2 months but it has been an amazing experience since I bought it Ive recently upgraded the exhaust system to a set of Flowmasters and they even make the car more sweet to drive The only qualm I have is that my back seat and trunk are tiny  This car was fun to drive stock but I needed more  After a few inexpensive MODS it is now really fun to drive  Add ons include MagnaFlow Cat back exhaust Steeda UnderDrive pulleys Steeda TriAxe short throw shifter CL 85mm MAF with TrueFlow intake pipe KN air filter 373 Ford Performance gear in the rear end These were only a 1500 investment and really woke up my GT  This is the 2nd Mustang I have owned the first being a 01 Mustang Conv Its simply the best 4 seater convertible for the money  The car looks great with the top down and the auto top is easy to use and opens quickly  It has enough power to be fun but not dangerous  Its a solid smooth ride which is exceptional for convertibles  the top is a little load and it would   SEATS ARE VERY COMFORTABLEDESPITE THE   Very good car better than I expected   I love this car I have owned 15 cars   If you dont require the power of the GT this car should work for you Total blast to drive  no regrets on giving up the practical sedan for this one  I have driven my car for about 8 months   This is a small car with a big car ride Plenty of power Fun to drive Had a few things go bad AC trans starter  alternator Ford replaced trans Other costs less than a 1000  I went into the dealership with a fixed price on my mind  the invoice  I was able to get the actual invoice price from the internet  With that and the offer of 3000  I was able to get this beauty for 20000 total financed 360month  The car was actually for my Wofe who just got a new job and I had promised her a new car especially the Mustang since that is what she always wanted  She loves it I love it its fun to drive and has enough power to show off sparingly on the highway  I would recommend this honey to anyone especially for those car enthusiasts  I always wanted one since highschool Now in my 30s I finally got one Tradition and Realability is the reason why I bought one If you want power on the road get one If you want others to see who is driving next to them at a stop light get one If your tired of paying crazy money for a simple tuneup or maintanence for your foreign car get one If you want style elagance and very expensive car get a Mercedes or a Jaguar My past cars were all foreign Mercedes Jaguar Acura Maxima and a Jetta This is my first American Car and baby I love it  We were looking for something more fun   Much faster stock than a Civic and can buy used for cheap Handles well easily modified to be very fast Its a bit heavy but turning and braking are still good Cheaper than a Camaro and more easily modified  This car is great it runs really   After driving SUVs and sedans for over 15 years and reaching close to 40 and enjoying my Camaro in 1994 I wanted to go back to an inexpensive sport vehicle I Love the ride and comments about my mustang and my 17 year old daughter loves to practice her driving in it also  I bought this car new in Feb 2000 and has been a great car Still has original brake pads after over 85000 miles plus does not burn any oil Nice and comfortable with plenty of pickup for passingLooking forward to turning 100000 next year since it has been trouble free since I bought it and will continue to drive itThanks Ford this was a nice surprise  I have the v6 convertable with 5 speed in blueblack topleather interior No mechanical failures with car No data on 5 speed aside from my ownno problems notchyocc missed shift Insurence is expencive a new Corvet would only be 750 more per month an RX 8 would be 250 less per month The v6 with 5 speed is about as quick as the v8 with automatic and provides enough performance to satisfy most people who want v8 power The convertable top is excellent shows no wear after 4 years of taking it up and down daily in the blazing Arizona sun To sum it up a bargain used performance car that is dependable and fun but expencive to insure Never had such fun in a ragtop Handling is nice and involving I can throw out the back end and control it It zips round country lanes with ease it turns heads it leaves boy racers standing Now where can I get me the money for a Saleen SC  At least the car look good  My wife bought this car before we were married and as soon as she could she pawned it off on me  It doesnt handle well  My road to work is twisty and I had always enjoyed seeing what my car can do on it  The mustang handles like a brick On the inside the seats are not very good on the lower back and the seatbelts tend to turn in such a way that when you close the door the buckle jams the door and cuts into the paneling  All in all I have not enjoyed this car  I bought this car in January 2001 and for the most part its been a great car Been through several accidents and still in one piece never an injury  Had to have the brakes replaced and the engine serviced once but thats really it Runs well accelerates really nicely a fun car to drive especially in electric green I just wanted to reply to someone saying that it ran well in rain and snow it DOESNT run in rain or snow very very touchy spins out a LOT Im trading it in this year for something with AWD For what I used it for though it was a great car  Long before the time I was old enough to even sit behind the wheel of a car I dreamed of owning a mustang That dream finally came true and I could not be happier This 2000 silver mustang convertible with a black top is simply amazing From performance to looks I believe that body style of the mustang from 9904 is one of the best body styles since the mustangs of 196412 67 I wish the gas mileage was a little better but I can not complain because I am finally driving a mustang  I have had a great experience with this automobile It has turned heads from day 1 Everybody comments on this car especially the sleek look and its curb appeal I have never had any major issues with this car The drivers door window motor was replaced shortly after I purchased other than that it has been no issues at all This is a FORD product it was built well  This car is a real head turner  and without any nonfactory adjustments Great styling a comfortable ride and reasonable fuel efficiency make this car a great package The 6 cylinder is a little tame but makes for an excellent cruiser to take on long trips  especially along the beach or other scenic areas Once you go topless its hard to go back  Its a blast to drive and a real head turner espically with the top down  Big down side to me no available Roll Bar offered and its a royal pain in the to put the tops Boot Cover on  The V6 could use some more HP but the gas mileage is good and the insurance rates are lower than witha V8  Just gets better with age  Recaro seats in front with be a nice touch and offer bette  I bought this vehicle used in 2003   I wanted a convertible  I read the V8 was a more reliable engine so I went with that  After rebate and dealer discounts the Mustang was 2k LESS than a comparably equipped Miata  I feel safer in a larger car  I can pass other cars on the freeway quite easily now  Love driving with the top down and the exhaust sounds great  Not the best looking inside or out  And not the most reliable compared to Japanese  But thousands of  cheaper so figured that would offset  I love my Mustang I only drive it in   this car is an excellent car i wouldnt   Ive owned a 2001 Mustang Convertible for about a year now and I must say it is a vast improvement over the boring Frontwheel drive sedan I owned before The power with the V6 is adequate though not stellarbut a few aftermarket performance parts can solve that problem The car is also surprisingly sturdy handling a collison with a toyota pick up with minimal damage By far its best attribute is its agility  We bought the car new and 8 hours later I had my first speeding ticket What a fun car to drivewith a radar detector  Interior fit and finish is lacking and the convertible top allows any and all outside noise to enter but thats where the Mach stero system shines It drowns out all the outside noise while you put the car through its paces The V8 provides plenty of zip We had a 6 cylinder version of the 1996 Mustang for 4 years and it struggled to get out of its own way In my opinion the 6 cylinder version of this car is a big waste of your money Be sure to include an extra 250 for a good radar detector  I bought this car new in 2000  Its held up well but not great and has been good transportation  The fact that its stylish and performs well doesnt hurt either  As a convertible its as solid as anything else on the road today at least in the under30k market  The interior is great  its comfortable and it has solid ergonomics  That being said I dinged the interior a couple of points because of cheap materials and appearance  All in all a great car for the money  Love the look of this year before it became more angular If youre going to buy a Mustang why would you get anything less than the GT  V8 engine This car has great power and is a blast to drive One of the best convertibles in this price range  This is the best car i have ever owned  I bought this car two years ago with only 8500 miles It was babied by the original owner I have put another 7000 miles on it during the non winter months Great to drive ultra sharp looking have not had one problem yet Best present I ever bought for myself  After turning 40 Momma decided she wanted to pick out her own car She chose a ragtop 40th anniversary pony She didnt want the GT so she chose the Premium edition convertible black top black paint black leather The car drives great but after driving a GT demo while waiting for this vehicle to come in  well theres really no comparison  power wise However this is a great car for mom to drive to work and back and around town  This car is absolutely a great ride For the price you get everything from leather to power  I paid 11000 less for this mustang than my brother did for his G35 Coupe 6MT and the mustang is still faster  Great car that Ive had since new Ive never had any problems with anything Regular fluid changes filters and lube and shes ready to go Was a daily driver for the first 4 years now a garage queen that only comes out when the weather is nice Fun car to drive  could use a few more horsepower but overall a cool fun to drive little carany help on modifications would be greatly appreciated  I was the owner of a 94 Roush Stage III Mustang until 1999 The new 2004 Mustang we bought was all the fun and excitment that a Mustang was meant to be  Of course I rated gas milage low The a powerful V8 engine it wasnt made for going far on a little gas I knew that before I drove it home The car is fun to drive  That covers it all I am a school bus driver and after bouncing around in a slow moving bus I feel alive again when I get behind the wheel of a truly fun car With the satellite option in the radio and the Mach 460 sound system it has great performance from a factory stereo as well  So far this car has been very good for me It has a lot of style gets very good mileage and everyone who has ridden in it has been impressed We plan to keep it for many years everything was great interior exterior how the car works looks feelsand rides it is also really fun to drive  Purchased a GT convertible   Plenty of power to go with the good looks Ride is a typical sports car but very strong in the corners  The car just jumps ahead when you put your foot in it  At 60 it is very enjoyable  This is one of the best cars I have   super car to drive lots of fun on the   The Mustang still hold true to american   Take a test drive and you ll know what   Other than expected chassis flex this has been a zero defect carStandard radio6 CD changer is very good even at freeway speeds with the top down Top fits much better than my 1986 GT Conv There is very little tire road inside the cabin  even less than a friends 2004 Accord  Surprisingly quiet ride with top up  Fuel economy 184 mpg is nothing to brag about but then my foot can be very heavy at times At least it uses 89 octane  It is not as fast as my WRX but then chicks dig it  If this is an example of current Ford quality then I can recommend it wholeheartedly     I am a nearly 60 year old grandmother and my husband just bought me this marvelous machine  for our 41st wedding anniversary And we LUV it  Weve had several fun new cars in our years but I believe this one is the best yet  Or maybe its because were old and dont remember the real meaning of fun anymore None the less we put 4000 miles on it the first month and have NO complaints  I would recommend it to everyone  Especially those who think its not an old people car   The car with the six cylinder engine has just the right mix of fun sportiness and can fit my family of 4 when we need to Not to agressive but with all the right tendencies and a little rumble The dealership I worked with was supurb when it came to setting our expectations of the car servicing our needs taking the time with us to get the right car It took us many trips there to decide  its our third car It was Arlington Heights Ford in Arlington Heights IL Everyone in the family is pleased  I waited 22 years for this car  It has   Overall an excellent car I am very happy with my Mustang I love the MACH 460 Audio System I have put in 2 40 series Flowmasters and believe me it would scare anyone that you come across with at the stop light   I bought this car while in College at 20000 miles  Served me great with no mechanical or driving problems except one small pressure cable that helps to lift the roof up broke  figures if I take the top up and down like every dayThat was the only thing to fix My Car has 120000 miles on it right now and runs like the same day I bought it  I would recommend this car to anyone who loves to experience a convertible and has a joy for driving  With a few easy modifications adding up to 335 hp and 373 gears this GT is the fastest quickest fun ride I have ever owned Theres nothing better than feeling the wind in my hair while rocking out to my favorite tunes in this reliable rockship on a perfect springsummer day or evening  This is the car I have been saving my pennies for this one compares to my 1973 Convertible for power and comfort Love it The Ford Mustang convertible is an excellent car for those seeking a convertible however making a statement with a V8 is not a priority  It still keeps the classic American muscle car feel without costing customers money for a more powerful engine  A good buy for those not willing to drive a more compact and in my opinion inferior looking convertible  The car is absolutely awesome it has power and stamina cant touch it  I love my car it drives great the radio is awesome and I love the competition orange color  This is my third Mustang and I love it  fun to drive and comfortable  Peppy and Reliable  The last one had more than 140000 miles with only one clutch and one set of brakes  Fun as hell to drive I have a beautiful Red Metal Flake paint job with white roof and white leather interior Also have the Mach 1000 sound system I get compliments constantly wow nice car  this is the BEST car u can buy its   If You want a real MUSCLE CAR the Mustang GT is the way to go There is no pussyfooting around in this beast Put be prepared to drive This is no V6 passanger style The GT has a rugged suspention so as to feel the road and the power that the car holds Its Bullish apearance mimics the muscle beneath the hood Old fasion power when you hit the excelorater and a new tight handling that reins far above the squirrly handling of the V6 Do not try to compare the beast to the puppy They are not in the same class Piorities for purchasing are Looking HOT Driving like you mean it and simple quality at its finest And the sound system Rocks  Car is a blast to drive tons of power and great handling with a few improvements car turns heads Never had a mechanical problem  i have always dreamt about getting a mustang since i was nine and it has finally happened a beautiful black mustang gt convertible all mine a dream come true I have loved every minute inside this car i cannot get enought of it i will own this car till the day i die i will never buy another car and if i do it would be another ford There is no car on the road that is like the mustang it is a car that women and men alike love and respect and there is so many things you can do to it to make it your own i love this car sure the interior isnt upscale but its not meant to be and it serves its purpose  fast good looking comfortable and the only surviving american muscle carwhat else can you say  Absolutely love this car  So much fun   I have owned mine for 6 months and am   At age 62 I told my wife I wanted one  The tires shine the dealership used stained my white car so parts of it had to be repainted  The clockcd unit had to be replaced because the clock lost min 10 minutes per wk  But my Tang is a beauty and lots of fun to drive Get 21 mpg on local drives and 26mpg on trips  It is my Bopping Baby  Love it  Ive always been a Mustang lover so   As a single affluient American male of the Babyboomergeneration  I choose to reward myself with an occasional gift The gift that I gave myself was the Ford Mustang with all of the bells and whistles available Monday through friday I will break out the S Jag the last word in motoring but on weekends when fun is the goal it is the Mustang that I choose The car is a joy to drive  I have had my car for a year  still love driving it every chance I get  I wouldnt trade it for any other ragtop out there  The ride is a little choppy at times but that adds to the sports car feel  It gets great gas mileage on the highway for a V8 2324 much better than around town 1618 so of course I take it out on the highway any chance I get  It looks great  draws attention everywhere it goes  Who cant resist a bright red Mustang ragtop  this is a really god car for me because   Its the pony with the 40th Anniv package 6cyl moves like an 8cyl nice carnice colornice ride Its a sports car The only Ford I would ever buy and Chevy had only the corvette The Sebrings I test drove you could feel the engine struggle it was sad Dont need the power or special needs of an 8cyl That happens to be the only kinds of cars I would up with Now I use Reg unleaded and I cruise    Love the convertable Easy to use Wind noise is noticable but not bad for a convertable No problems so far with the car about 38000 miles on it Gas mileage is ok  24 milesgallon on average  We LOVE it  We are no kids  in fact we are 60ish We bought the car on a whim and after 7000 miles in less than two months we are having a ball with it It is soooo much fun to drive  Have been very happy with the car so   I had love mustangsince I was sixteenthat when I saw my first mustang I do injoy driving my 2004 V8GT mustang but I am dispointed in interior its cheap I was also over price for this car  I paid for my 2004 ford mustang  32000  I found aniversary package was nothing to brag about I still looking for the deluxe in 2004 anniversary package  fun to drive fun to own turns   This car looks good feels good and is a blast to drive  I get comments from strangers about what a sharp car I drive whenever were out cruising with the top down   This is an awesome fun car  Ive loved Mustangs since I was a kid Loved the first Mach 1s and already own a 98 coupe  My husband recently bought me a 04 convertible and I love this car  The exterior design is classy and the interior is plush I have to say the under carriage is a bit stiff and creaks on bumpy roads but out on the open road it handles very well     ITS A GREAT RIDE IF YOURE LOOKING TO   Even though the platform is old Ford kept the car current  Mustang is and always will be more than a car  It is an icon to a lifestyle that Americans both young and old still want to hold on to  Long live the pony car  Ive been looking at the GT Convertible for some time  Just got out of a 4 cylinder Honda  What a difference This car rocks I have the torch red with black top and black interior GA Dawg fan with the car to match Power to burn handling is amazing  This is a true American Muscle Machine  I bought mine with 1400 miles so got the deal of the century  Lucky to be 40 and get the 40th anniversary pony car  Nothing rivals it  Take the Ford Mustang GT but add some   6 cyl is underpowered for this   I have had my convertible for over a year now and have had absolutely no problems  It is just an automatic v6 mustang but it is still fun and comfortable to drive  All of the problems that I have heard of from people who have owned convertibles are nonexistent  I have had no problems with leaks tears or cuts  Being in college I was also looking for a dependable car that would have no problems with trips home  I put higher performance touring tires on it and it drives much better  Although this car did need a new transmission just before the warranty expired it has been troublefree since   My ford mustang was purchased preowned   I love my convertible My kids 4 and 5 love it too  There is nothing like cruising down the road with your top down and enjoying life I have ridden in other convertibles Sebring and yuck I wouldnt trade my Mustang for one It is comfortable fun reliable and most of all a conversation piece wherever I go  Especially in East Tennessee where I live  My car is an Electric Green color and Cleopatra my car gets eyeballed coming and going So anyone that is thinking about getting a Mustang I would definitely encourage getting a convertible They are too much fun  I am a tall person and most of the   Probably the poorest engineered  and poorest quality vehicle Ive ever owned its my 10th vehicle  Ive had nothing but problems since I bought the car I actually got it in July 2002 Im glad the dealer decided to sneak a premium extended warranty in on the contract I have a feeling a lot more will go wrong after the initial 36000 miles  Was at the dealership to buy a Focus Out on the lot they had parked all of the Foci next to a Redfire color Mustang convertible 40th anniversary special  It said buy me to me Either that or the saleman had super telepathic powers  Dealer must have seen me coming  I couldnt resist Really great car to drive  Want to keep it forever  I was excited to finally drive a Mustang that is why I decided to rent one for a few days The 6 cyl engine with the automatic tranmission is underpowered This car is slow and feels heavy The interior build quality seems very cheap The plastic holding the window buttons on the drivers side door is already loose at 14K miles I am 62 and the height of the interior seems OK The seats are alright as well The 6 disc changer stereo sounds good I have not tried to remove the top because it seemed complicated This might be an OK car but I would expect much more from a Mustang in terms of performance even if this is an automatic one  best car I have ever seen  This is my 2nd mustang my first was a 1965 red pony which my brother and I drove into the ground This one will be better cherished Im short 5 and can comfortably drive this car I love the way it handles and the auto top is the bomb  I can reach everything  I bought the laser red GT Convertible new in 1998 for my wifes 49th birthday  Its just had its 30K dealer service and only 3 minor items showed up The rear brake pads and the original battery are nearing replacement and there is slight oil seepage at the steering rack not enough to even spot my garage floor though Other than replacing the original tires at 22K miles and normal maintenance I have spent 0 on repairs Its been trouble free and burns no oil between 3K mile changes It has all factory options except the engine block heater and they all still work fine too I gave the interior a 7 only because legroom is a bit cramped for tall drivers and the seat belt frays  The heritage lives on What a wonderful American sports car that combines affordabilty with performance The GT achieves a 060 time in 56 seconds and does with style The premium package is a bargain to add to the GT car If youre in the market for a fun to drive reliable and affordable muscle car this is your ride  I love this car  My whole family is jealous  My mom who drives a Porshe Boxter is always asking if she can drive it  It has good horsepower Fun to drive  This is the best Mustang I have driven  This car is great  It handles very good passing gear is really great sterio is fantastic it is an eye catcher on the road cruises without any effort everything about this car is what I expected Only thing I see wrong is that now that I have mine is that I see a lot of others ones on the road now  Frustrated owner of a new 2004 with only 1400 miles  The first 300 the car started leaking oil  They supposely fixed this then went on a road trip around 350 miles oil leaked again  Found out that there are 181 cars out there that have this problem  Ford will not take back the car which I want them to do Dealer is ok but certain higher ups were rude to meWATCH OUT  I was looking for a ragtop as my second car and I found an 03 with 3500 miles on it  Ive had the car for two months and what a kick in the pants to drive  It has a great sound system Mach 1000 upgraded wheels more than enough power handles tight I could go on an on Im just kicking myself for waiting this long to buy a pony car  I purchased this 01 Mustang with 44K miles already logged  Mileage is now 68K with only one tune up and a change of disk brakes pads  Very reliable averages 23mpg all the time  Convertible top is very easy to operate  Great fun economical car  Looks fast sitting still   Ive owned my 1999 convertible Mustang for 5 years with only 1 problem I had a problem shortly after I bought it with one of the convertible top hydraulics going out The car was used with 17000 miles on it before I got it and apparently someone tried taking the top down with it still latched into the windshield and this caused the failure Other than that I have had no mechanical problems with this car and it is used as a daily driver The Mustang is a little bumpy because of the sports suspension and height from the ground but thats what you come to expect in a performance RWD car Dont expect to be riding like a Caddy in this bad boy but youll ride in style  This car is a head turner because of the looks the sound and the power Ford has done an incredible job of keeping the Mustang at the forefront of motor vehicle desirability Fun to drive affordable attractive Very nice package  Forty years ago I wanted a Mustang convertible  But after the late 60s I didnt like the body style  When it changed in 1995 I was determined once again to own one  This is probably the most FUN car Ive ever owned and its classic lines really get the looks  The interior couldve used more thoughtful designing and the gas mileage isnt the greatest even with a sixcylinder automatic not my first choice but I bought it used I love driving it and plan to do so for awhile yetuntil I can afford the retro 2005  This car is so much fun to drive especially with the top down  Everyone agrees its a great looking car My first car was a 67 Mustang and I always vowed I get another one day The incentives in December were too good to pass up on so I opted to buy then instead of waiting for the 2005s to come out I am not unhappy with my decision at all  After searching out what I thought would be a great car I found a car that is not so great I am 64 and the interior for me is horrible The seats are angled weird My knee hit the turn signal all the time Why is it so low Poor design inside I enjoy the look of the exterior which is what caught my eye to begin with But it is not the car I was thinking it would be A let down Fast and good looking yes but a lot of money for just a plastic FORD Very cheaply made and little to no quality put into it I had a 300z before this and I am going back to the Z Day and Night Rent one first before buying a Mustang I should have  I have driven a lot of cars and have had many many new cars and this is the best of them all I have to say I sold a 1972 Pantera to buy one of these guys This Mustang will run circles around the Pantera Ford is on the right track with this pony I say drive it first and you will be sold Be sure to buy it loaded and the V8  This car amazes me Its just a v6 but seems to have plenty of powerThe same 6 as the Explorer traded in on it Such a difference Im amazed at the looks I get just driving around Makes it well worth the price It drives and handles very well for a nonperformance version Although it did snow the second day I had it and I had to remember how to drive with RWD been a long time since I did that But after a couple of miles it all came back to me I guess thats the advantage of being over 50 Overall its a very solid car no back seat room to speak of but then again I wasnt looking for any  I love this car  It is the best and most fun car I have ever owned  Its eye catching fun to drive and makes me feel good whenever I get in it  especially when I can get out there with the top down and the music blaring  Its not possible to be mad sad or in a bad mood when you are in this car  I got it in Torch Red with a Parchment top  absolutely perfect  I got my convertible 2 months ago and I love it Its so much fun to drive around and I cant go anywhere without someone commenting on the car Theres really no other car like it  I was looking for a convertible and test drove the 40th Anniversary in December to take it off my list because I was sure it was going to be too small Once I got in it I knew it was mine  It is fun to drive and fun to own  I could never have imagined how many heads this vehicle has turned Though it is a convertible it is really quiet inside with loads of muscle when I need it Ford got this one RIGHT  I love my car Its so much fun to drive around everyone stares The is also no wind noise when the top is up  It drives great on rainy days and has tight steering and great turning radius  Its great  A real sports car at a real price nothing more needed for street driving Very powerful car and handles excellent Ttraction control is a great option as well although I have the automatic transmission version of this ca ItÂ’s a real fun drive and has been a very reliable car  I have owned a 1965 and a 1969 Mustang but this car is a whole new experience Havent had so much fun and enjoyment in 30 years Ford has really done a magnificent job with this PONY The V6 I purchased has everything the GT has except fog lampsdual exhaust a V8 and 17 inch tires  My wife was thinking of getting a new car I surprised her with a new Mustang I was gonna buy a coupe but my dealer gave me a great deal on a convertible As there are still so few convertibles available we were lucky to get one and are we glad we did Its screaming yellow just like all the print ads I added the GT grill and fog lights and the car is a real head turner We love it The car is a blast to drive and the V6 has plenty of power No need for a GT This is the best Mustang to date  This car is a beauty in all ways  The style the handling the interior and the sporty exterior  We ordered our 05 V6 convertible exactly the way we wanted it with all the bells and whistles It took 2 months to get here but it was well worth the wait  My husband and I are both enjoying this car like no other we have every had  We ride with the top down everyday and we live in AZ we may be hot but at least were styling and loving it  My first convertible Coming from an SUV I worried about driving a car  This is fun fun fun Love the retro look inside and out Although I downsized it is roomier than expected  I can pack up for the beach in no time Good pick up glides through traffic even in the rain  I saw the new Mustang and it was MUST HAVE IT  I have no disappointment at all  The features are easy to use the drive is FUN FUN FUN  The LX 6 cylinder 40 convertible is great  Ride is smooth even when you hit some bumps   Talked with some people who have the GT and their only complaint is the gas mileage   If you have never owned a Mustang this is my first one dont hesitate  GET IT  First of all the car is beautiful  It has a wonderful retro look to it and yet is styled for the modern consumer  The legend lime paint is a beautiful color and blends perfectly with the parchment interior and top The leather seating is very comfortableYou are able to retract and replace the top with minimal effort I was also surprised with the trunk room  It appeared to be small but when I put in my files and bag for work I was surprised to see I still had room for much more in the trunk The driving power was a pleasant surprise for a V6 and the ability to turn so tightly with such stability is incredible I am very happy with my purchase   This car has consistently ruled for 40 years and it will continue to rule in my opinion  My dream is one day to own the original Bullitt mustang  I think I know the car well as in my lifetime I have owned 13 different Mustang models from the tiny Mustang 2 all the way to a 93 Cobra  This car has never ever failed me and as long as I live there will be a Mustang parked in my garage ready to run  Waited 6 weeks after ordering for delivery V6 Premium convertible White with Parchment top and parchment leather interior upgrade package 5 speed auto antilock brakestraction control exterior sport appearance package Even nonFord fans cant help but take a second look and make positive comments Neighborhood kids coming by to take a look Power and shift ranges seems just about right for a v6 After careful examination cant find any flaws with paint or fit of exterior parts Still playing with the My Color dash light feature cant decide on color I like bestTop is getting easier to lock down after raising it as it stretches Less than expected road noise with top up  The Mustang GT drives great and looks fantastic It has very comfortable seats and is a pleasure to cruise in on the highway I think its ultimate handling abilities exceed my willingness to explore them but when pushed through the twisties this car would probably put certain 2 seater sports cars to shame With the 5 speed manual the acceleration is outstanding and the incredible exhaust note under power makes the car a total blast to drive Another thing I have noticed over the 4 months I have owned this car is that almost everyone who sees it rides in it or drives it wants one too My wife loves the car too and we are extremely pleased with our purchase our first Mustang by the way  My husband says I have an unnatural emotional attachment to this car A rearwheeldrive convertible is not the most practical vehicle for Montana but I dont care I am in love with this car Im having my midlife crisis early while I can still enjoy it This car is an absolute BLAST to drive top up or top down I have always wanted a red Mustang convertible my grandpa had a 64 12 baby blue Mustang coupe and never thought I would be able to afford one Not only is this car gorgeous but its AFFORDABLE This car is a future classic  I still own my first car after driving it for 32 years  My Dad bought a 66 Thunderbird Convertible for my Mom in late 65  It is still my favorite of my 12 cars  For the first time since I got the Tbird at 16 years old I am in love with my car again  Highly recommended the car has proven to be pure fun  I traded up from a 1994 Mustang 50 What a drastic difference in performance comfort and styling Every day I catch people staring at my vehicle The Shaker 1000 stereo system sounds better than my home stereo  The vehicle is everything Ford designers intended it to be This automobile is sleek in every aspect the exterior and the old body design to the sporty look not so much the European look on the interior  Excellent exterior design Windveil blue is the coolest color Gets up and goes with great handling Shaker 500 CD system is awesome although loading the CDs into the 6 CD changer is confusing and slow Only beef on interior is central column kind of hits against my right leg Mine doesnt have MyColor or trip computer    Have had other convertibles in the past  this one is by far THE most fun to drive  Exterior is stylish with that retro feel  Interior is more comfortable than I expected unless you are in the rear seat Car is surprisingly quiet even when driving with the top and all windows down  you can actually hold a normal conversation  Engine is strong and transmission is smooth  5 speed automatic  While cruising the engine is pretty quiet  when you step on the gas youll hear that throaty rumble that lets you know whats under the hood  This car really is a blast to drive  This is the first new Mustang I have ever owned and it is GREAT  I have an 89 LX convertible that I have owned since 89 and have had a 65 Mustang This car is faster tighter better made and looks better than any Mustang ever built  Great convertible aero design minor wind   Great performance cool sound east to drive The best one yet Ford did it right this time  This car was my party vehicle throughout my college years I have 145000 miles on it and all I had to do was change the oil My convertible top hydraulics began to leak at 100000 and that is all I had to fix Of course since I take the top down and put it back up a million times when I went out it had to break eventually   I plan on driving this bad boy until 200000 miles and keeping it as my fun vehicle  Waited 3 months but it was well worth the wait I ordered without having driven a GT or a convertible I am thrilled The car is comfortable powerful  looks terrific The exhaust sound is almost worth the price by itself I get stares wherever I go Ford has done a tremendous job on the Mustang at realistic prices  The interior upgrade package does a decent job of minimizing the plastic look  feel of the cockpit although I would have been willing to spend a bit more for a little more luxury inside  a passenger seat with power controls  I have a silver 02 v6 automatic Convertible  which is so much fun to drive But not a lot of get up and go from a stop but has plenty of highway power I should have either got the GT or a 5 speed for to dead stop power  This is a really cool car  Love to drive it  We get a lot of stares  The color is what grabs your attention  It is a cool blue with beige interior  I think Ford would sell more of these if they would target women with the lighter interior color as oppose to the typical black  This baby takes off when needed  It reminds me of my 1981 V6 280Z  Love that car  I think the GT is really a waste of power  Where will you be able to open it up without looking over your shoulders  Between my wife and myself we have ownership experience with close to 40 automobiles  We have owned 2 2005 Mustangs in under 3 months  We traded our silver convertible when we went for the first oil change and were shown a beautiful torch red loaded V6 convertible  The stick handles smoothly The engine has great punch for a 6  The silver was an automatic and was also very pleasing to drive  These autos corner and change lanes with agility  The leather seats of our red are much more comfortable than the cloth with more padding where it counts     I just got my V6 Convertible in June and must admit that I havent been able to keep my hands off the steering wheel since The ride is very stable There is almost no pull through tight turns The rear wheel drive makes the ride smooth on bumpy New England roads and I dont have to worry about spilling my coffee The instrument panel design is great No clutter and easy to read Driving this car is exhilarating and fun I have to get used to thumbs up signals nice car wow and the likes comments and lots of stares from fellow drivers   Negative side is that everyone wants to race you and I am too old for that type of stuff  Customer service is a 2  All this talk about the V8 being so great  well I test drove it and thought it was too masculine and loud for a females taste  In addition I requested to exchange a hood with no spoiler  I love the new design of the Ford Mustang with its smooth lines  without the spoiler and the fog lights gag  gag and gag  This look is the real Mustang  Love the Windveil blue Best idea is to purchase the car with cloth seats and then upgrade leather at dealers cost  only 116300  This is as close to heaven as you can possibly get while on this earth Though I must say that I would have preferred an original Â‘64 12 this car is just as great to own drive and ride in  If you have the means I highly recommend picking one up even if only for a test drive or as a rental car  This car will make even the biggest nerd feel like a star  I have been in love with these cars for as long as I can remember and this car is the only one that I would even consider categorizing as one of my favorite cars beside the original Â‘64 12 red with white wall tires and white leather interior and a white convertible top with all original parts  Mustang handles excellent 6 speed manual engages easily Pick up phenomenal Convertible easy to put up and down Ride is easy and comfortable for a sports car Looks great too  Purchased for my wife and its an amazing vehicle  I own a Hummer and and BMW so this is the summer car and it delivers  Tremendous power awesome interior red w accent and great exterior retro look  It turns heads whereever we go  Nice backseat room in comparison to other years models   I havent been in the Mustang market for years After the 60s and early 70s they seem to have lost their appeal to me anyway  I have the V6 premium fully loaded black with red leather interior The new style brought me back  I am very happy with the purchase  so reasonably priced  Have never had any problems with my 1999 Mustang convertible  I love this car Am considering trading for the 2005 but having a hard time parting with this one  This car is so fun to drive  I had a 2002  Mustang and it cannot compare to the new one  I feel safer the roof is not so close to your head  I absolutely recommend this car with no hesitations  The FORD Mustang GT Convertible is a blast and a treat to enjoy  Even as a 2001 model purchased used online I am pleased with the performance  The only ding would be the fake hood scoop leaks water a good half an hour after a car wash and thus leave water spots on the hood etc  Otherwise let the good times roll  Waited several months to receive delivery on Red Convertible  Everything I expected  Have taken three trips around Colorado over 12000 foot mountain pass into South Dakota and through Wyoming Montana Canada Rockies Washington Oregon and Utah  Handled beautifully Very responsive A solid car corners very well makes driving fun again  I get at least one compliment each time I take it out on the road  I cant decide what I like best about this car  I have had so many people stop and look at the car and just say its beautiful  Then I hop in and drive its a blast it just rips off the line and handles crisply  The seats are comfortable and the wind noise is better than my old Miata  The only disappointment is the Shaker 500 stereo it lacks sophistication and the CD player is very finicky with MP3 discs  The door mounted subwoofers cause the door handles to vibrate and hum when handling low frequencies  Outstanding could not find a better car so I bought it I would do it over again and again A far out automobile  I ordered in December from a dealer that had no allocation Reordered in April finally arrived June Top ripped around window factory just replaced The AC was  better colder in my 2000 No inside glove box truck release Why only 1 rear window switch for both The key rubs your leg should be higher Shaker 1000 not worth the money besides eats trunk space Quiet fast good looking no doubt this car is a classic Even with the faults where could you buy a better car for the money Headlights are great for the back roads Backseat not bad in a pinchThis car stands out in a crowd  This car is a real looker you would swear it had eyes Mine has the roll bar it is killer to look at Then the light turns green pure exhilaration you have to behave because 060 in 57 seconds can get you in deep quick I have ridden in more comfortable cars but admit that if I want comfort I will take my Mark VI This Ford product is tops to drive and own   Ive had my 2003 Ford Mustang Convertible for a couple of months and I am having such fun  When the top is down it turns everyones head It has no fear of increased speed and is a dream to drive in the hills and on long trips to the ocean  Its just perfection  It had an exhaust leak when I purchased it  though it wasnt detected by the dealerships topnotch service team  The local oilchanging place heard it and the dealership had it repaired  Apparently it is a recall or it is just a common problem  Other than that its been the most fun Ive had since I gave up the keys to my minivan LOL  I love my car it is great in the mountains  just pure fun  Bought from CarMax at 18k miles  1k miles later they rebuilt the rear gear box to try to get rid of the moaning sound between 40 and 50 miles an hour on deceleration  Never worked  At 90k the gear box was rebuilt again because of a constant whir Lets see at 70k I got a new front end Tops starting to leak Valves tap a lot if you dont keep cleaning the injectors   Travel 150 miles a day at an average 72 miles an hour  Time to clean injectors again and probably replace the egr valve  My 9th Ford and probably my last if Toyota makes a larger truck  Ive been a Mustang owner 2 weeks now and wow asking myself why I waited so long Jet black V6 premium convertible with upgraded interior black leather black top and exterior sports package Cant forget those side airbags and the active antitheft for the insurance break With the new body style it is a head turner from its shiny black exterior to its trippy old style rims The driving experience is wonderful hard to put into words really but you could judge by the big grin on my face each time I drive it The MPG advertised was accurate I get about 17 city and up to 25 freeway the main difference is I WANT to drive it and I take the long way just so I get to drive it more  At 67 leg room is a must and this Mustang delivers mucho leg room  Getting 30 miles to the gallon  This is a fun car to drive around town It gets decent gas mileage and is reliable I purchased this vehicle new and it has never had a single mechanical problem  This car has given me no trouble whatever  It has taken a lot of abuse from my son and has kept on ticking  Im very impressed with its performance and toughness  For the money its the finest car Ive seen  This car has definitely been fun to drive it handles great and has a lot of power  However I just spent two weeks in a rental because of rust on the panel above my windshield  The seal was faulty and 3 months out of warranty  I dont suggest an aftermarket car starter  My car has issues with starting due to it  Other than that I love it  With the rush to get the new 2005 Mustangs smart buyers bought the 2004 models at tremendous savings The convertibles were well built cars with no leftover kinks from prior years The performance for the 39L 6 cylinder is more than adequate and if you dont constantly floor it the gas mileage is outstanding We were able to obtain 25 mpg combined cityhighway on a 3900 mile vacation Incredible If you are in the market for a used nice looking sports car convertible do not hesitate to buy a LOW mileage adult driven model The price should be right with everyone else wanting the new styles No disappointments and with gas so high you can basically have it all with this model  I have been wanting a Mustang for as long as I can remember  Now I finally have one and its so much more than I imagined  At 61 years old and recently a widower  I asked my children if they thought I was going through a second childhood since I was considering purchasing a new Mustang GT convertible They all said if thats what you want go for it I did I had planned a trip to Las Vegas and decided to extend the trip and drive I made a two week trip covering 5500 miles from Georgia to California averaging 235 mpg and drove over 1000 miles on two different days The weather was great the car performed flawlessly and the ride was very comfortable This car is not the fastest or most expensive on the road but dollar for dollar is a fantastic value and a super performer Im looking forward to the GT500  I love this car  Its fast sporty comfortable and a real head turner Outstanding handling and pick up  With just a few tweaks here and there this car becomes a hybrid muscle car and sports car  Goes FAST sounds AWESOME great handling  like its superglued to the road  The best part about the tweaks  eg aftermarket exhaust  is that they dont compromise reliability or fuel economy The convertible top is very solid and secure when locked up no flapping or significant noisiness even on the highway  Topdown this car is a blast just as well and the MACH sound system can easily be heard over even a passing semi     After leasing Ford Mustangs for 12 years that covered 3 GTs fully equipped  I learned the hard lesson of buying a Ford My last Mustang GT had so many various problems that Ford continued to ignore that my engine blew with 61k miles I have had 2 tune ups oil changes on time a new fuel filter 5 new coils and so on Ford takes no responsibility in their failures and the defective Mustang I am never never going to buy a American car again Not only because it was a horror on wheels but worse  a corporate giant like Ford wanted to rip me off for 7000 dollars to fix again  my mechanic 1000  never again will I be caught in American cars I learned my lesson and they lost a customer forever  My sonic blue 2005 Mustang convertible is the most fun machine Ive ever owned Driving with top down warm wind in my face hairs mostly gone and feeling great as the feelings of youth return I love my Mustang This is the ultimate time machine Put on the Beach Boys or any other hits from the 60s crank up the stereo and wow  2005 Roush GT Sonic Blue Convertible  Having spent much of my late teens and early 20s restoring 67  68 Mustangs I was blown away when I first saw the 2005 retro Mustang Naturally I had to have one and bought myself a birthday present in June 05 I have about 2500 miles on the car and it has been flawless Its great fun to drive and Roush has tweaked the car just right from the exhaust to the ground effects Its spooky but I feel as if Im sitting in my 68 Fastback albeit a greatly improved version With the flood of after market products becoming available by the minute it will no doubt keep me busy again Cant wait to blow the doors off any retro Camaro or Cuda we may yet see  This car is an absolute kick  Ive had several Lincolns TCars  Mark 8s  Sebring convertibles  this car is my true favorite  Its quick  classy and a ton of fun to drive  I cant wait for spring to drop the top  I had it down on day 1  hated to put it up but  I live in Chicago  I love my new 2005 Mustang Convertible I ordered it through Ford and got the options I wanted Ive had the car now 10 months and it rides great Ive not had a bit of trouble with it It is my 2nd car so I only drive it when the weather is good  This car is Mustang through and through I bought this car because it reminded me so much of my 1967 coupe I love the retro styling and the performance fantastic This is not a bells and whistles car If you start comparing it to other midsizes it wont win many categories That being said this is the ultimate ride for muscle car fans and especially for Mustang aficionados  I purchased my convertible after much research between several makes The Mustang offered the best value for the money and even with the six cylinder is pretty fast  Finally finally we have a Mustang  the car we always wanted Bought used in almost perfect condition in and out Drives sweet looks fast  Wish there was a little more power in the standard but that is what the GT model is for New to a convertible but lovin it Stereo sounds awesome came with stock tape radio but put 240 watt Pioneer cd deck in and no need to say more Mustangs hold their value and are reliable and are just a fun ride  I have read everyones reviews about this Mustang and I must say I have had no problems with my car ever  Not only that but the people that I bought it from also had no problems with this car  So Im sorry for those of you who have had bad experiences mostly it was the fact you had a bad dealer but the car itself is amazing fast quick and very comfortable for two people the back seat is kinda small  I test drove many other sport convertibles but liked the ride of the Mustang best I would have picked the Honda 2000 but it is so tiny you better be 135 lbs and 55 The Nissan 350Z was nice but you feel every bump in the road This car is great except the quality of the interior for the price I had an F150 Lariat and the interior quality was far better equal price The leather seats are very nice but at 510 I find my knee resting against the center console The stereo is outstanding for a factory unit but I could tell no difference in the quality between the Shaker 500 and the 1000 even though the 1000 comes with a sub in the trunk  I purchased my first 2005 V6 convertible back in April 2005 when there were very few to be found I believe this dealer took advantage of that fact Anyway it was the Windveil Blue with a black topbeautiful   Always wanted a Mustang convertible I have a Shelby Mustang so performance  fun is important The price  insurance was surprisingly low I lost my company car due to cost containment and never shed a tear with this as my personal replacement for transportation to and from work  Sounds great for a six cylinder  Great pickuppower for a six cylinder  plenty of power  Not too pricey for a sporty car like this  reasonably priced Good buy for the money  Shaker 500 sound system sounds great  Gas mileage  about 20 mpg around town  is satisfactory   Ive had Camaros TransAms a Corvette and Mustangs and this is my favorite so far  I went from an SUV to the Mustang and I thought I would regret the size change but let me just tell you this WHAT A RIDE I have no regrets and think it is the best car I could have ever bought It handles like a true sports car should Want to let your hair down and have a great ride Get a Mustang   I just purchased my new 06 convertible Mustang  All black  This car is amazing  Drives like sports car and the same time feels like you are driving an old Cadillac  I was considering getting the V6 but after driving the V8 with manual transmission I was convinced  that the V8 was my answer for my new toy hands down If youre thinking about getting this car as an extra car for fun driving then I would recommend the manual V8  If you enjoy music and have an extra few dollars then get the Shaker1000   I drive the Mustang very little because I want to keep it really nice  It is redfire with the light parchment interior and top  The quality of the interior is not up to par with the imports but for the price the performance is a bargain  The car reminds me of my 1969 Ford Torino GT which is a good thing  The difference is that the Mustang actually handles well I think the Mustang is a great car for anyone who appreciates American v8 power It feels like the days of old but with refinement We havent had the car long but it looks great and runs like the stallion that it is  The interior is much quieter than I expected based on reviews unless you are in the throttle  I am fitting two kids in the back seat  tight fit but they love cruising with the top down  I bought this car in Sept of 05 and have only put 700 miles on it but what fun miles theyve been Best bang for the buck by far Handling acceleration braking and that infectious eye appeal are just some of the highs youll have while driving this all American beauty  This is a very stable convertible Very still ride not all loose and rubbery like most convertibles and the power is awesome  I ordered this car from the dealer in Redfire Metallic with a white top and white leather interior and a 5speed transmission  It has the chrome Cobra type spoke wheels that really shine  It is a joy to drive and really turns heads    While vacationing in South Beach Miami my wife and I rented a convertible We liked it so much we decided to buy one But let me tell you this Mustang GT is no ordinary convertible This car is much faster and handles better that advertised The interior in our opinion isnt too shabby either We really like the retro styling It is quite similar to the Mustangs of the 60s and 70s That is where the similarities end The ride is unbelievable for a car this price The interior is so quiet for a convertible And we havent been able to detect any cowl shake With the tires provided Pirelli Zero Neros you have to go out of your way to make this thing slide even a little A very nice car  My 03 Yellow Stang GT Convertible was an amazing find With only 3100 miles on it when I bought it in August of 05 I couldnt walk away With the Mach 1000 system built into it the 5 speed the color and being a convertible Im proud to have made the choice of purchasing my first true pony car Handles tight shifts solid loves 2nd gear Would highly recommend to anybody looking for a whole lot of power at a bargain price to check one of these out   I purchased my car private party about 3 years ago In the 3 years of owning it I have come to find a few things These are very tight convertibles well made with a lot of power  They are also one of the quietest on the road with the top up Plenty of power and decent gas mileage around town but can get very good when on the open road driving long distances  Coming from a 50 I was hesitant on a 46 car but made sure I got a 99up with the 265HP Plenty of power to set you straight  My only issue is the coolant sensor light that seems to be a typical issue with the 9900 cars  Get a 5 speed The resale on the automatic cars is poorer  I purchased a 2005 premium Mustang convertible its a steel blue with a black top I love My Color for the different colors you can make the dash It has a 500 watt stereo system in it iI just purchased the pony grille with the fog lamps in it I get so many compliments on the car I am going down Carlisle PA to the Mustang show  Had this car almost 6 years  purchased new  Havent had a single problem Runs like a breeze and everything is original  Body is still very tight and looks great  Mach stereo is awesome and sounds best with the top down  Car is a lot of fun to drive steering is a little heavy especially when trying to parallel park  Engine is fast on the top end slow down low  Can still beat 2006 Acuras and many Porsches Very happy with workmanship  the car looks and drives just as good as the day I bought it without a single squeak  Hope to keep for another 50 years  Always wanted a little pony and what I got was one with a lot of power and a pretty smooth ride for a sports car  It is the most fun to drive and it is definitely a head turner with its top down  I have had more compliments on this car than i had during my 35 years of driving  Ive had the car about a month now and I find it very comfortable inside and easy to drive The stereo is super I love the idea of the changing interior colors on the dash as well as the other features you would expect in a luxury car The exterior is awesome I have yet to take it on a long trip to see the gas mileage highway driving I recommend this car to anyone looking for a sports car  I purchased this car last spring after I was in an accident in my 2000 Mustang coupe  The convertible is a lot more fun of a car to drive around and I have been very happy with the reliability of both of the cars  I love the look and drive of the car as well and recommend the manual transmission and the V6 if you are doing your own maintenance more room in the engine compartment makes it easier to access   Road noise and comfort of the convertible make it much less enjoyable on long road trips  After an hour or two on the highway with the top down your ears will be ringing for hours afterwards   Also you will need excellent tires or more weight in the back to keep traction in rain or snow  I have never been so happy with a vehicle Im a 44 year old former hot rodder who has owned several muscle cars from the 1960s and 70s The 2005 Mustang represents the best of all those cars but on a modern platform that you can drive everyday under full warranty I have nothing but praise for how it looks drives and makes me feel when Im behind the wheel This car rocks with a capital R How Ford managed to combine the retro styling with practical driveability awesome performance and comfort plus head turning good looks while remaining the lowest priced 300HP car out there is pure genius  I picked this car in October of 05 after waiting 45 months for delivery It was worth the wait Ford hit not just a home run but a grand slam Exceptionally powerful and comfortable cruiser The world seems a better place when you are cruising in this future collectible with the top down All of 6569 Mustang styling cues in one package        I waited for Ford to bring back the Mustangs that I loved from the 60s My GT convertible is a great car to drive It has power styling and the car sounds great   Best Mustang ever I love the styling even better than the Shelby GT500 Handling ride and acceleration is outstanding Interior is easy to maintain comfortable and fits the character of the car It avoids the Tokyo by Night over abundance of electronic doodads that distract from a true drivers car  I just bought my car and it is awesome I get many many compliments on the look and it is so much fun driving it   Love my Stang Always drove Ford F150s and decided to downsize what a sweet ride   I have loved and owned Mustangs all my life I have had a 97 and 96 GT convertible Out of all the cars I have driven these were overall very good automobiles Yes they are going to have a few problems They seem to not have very good radiators because they tend to overheat some  Other than that Mustangs have overall been pretty good  Most that have problems with them is because the previous owner has mistreated the car they are mostly well built cars  I have been looking at a convertible mid life thing for a long time  For the price style and funtodrive the Mustang was the one Metallic red parchment top parchment leather seats I wanted a GT but the loaded ponypremium with 500 watt stereo  with the v6 was greatespecially since a GT this loaded was many thousands more and beyond my budget  I love this car and have rarely put the top up in the almost 3 weeks I have owned it Funny how the CDs sound so much better  How does one go through life without driving a convertible  Having had classic cars in the past I wanted something that would last and have excellent parts AND service availably wherever I want to travel  This is a fun car with excellent handling characteristics  It has excellent acceleration and road handling manners  I am impressed  My wife and I have enjoyed this Mustang for the past month since we traded in our 2004 Mustang Has surprising power and response that is enjoyable Lots of heads turn most responses we get is for the color Windviel Blue seems to have everyones attention My wife likes going from our Xtreme Blazer to the Mustang easy transition from one to another but starting out in second in the Chevy cant be done in the Mustang Well at least not for her  I bought it at end of March  Had to contact 17 dealers to get a GT convertiblewith a manual transmission People are always staring and telling me how much they love this car I never thought a car could make you more popular but this car has  It drives great The top is very easy to manage the pickup and speed are great This is truly a great Mustang If you can go for the convertible and V8 My wife and children used to say I was starting to drive like an old man They cant believe how Ive morphed into a speed fanatic I would buy it again it I had it to do over  So far no mechanical problems or bugs to work out Thats about it  Have only driven the car 1000 miles since purchase in March but very satisfied with its overall quality and speed The Mustang is a great sports car buy for the money spent compared to others   The 2006 Mustang must have been built with cost the most important item It has no under hood light foot well lights or daytime running lamps Small items to be sure but should not add to the total cost The five speed transmission does not shift smoothly Was told by the dealership that nothing could be done   The car is fun to drive and very comfortable during distance driving Ive owned it 2 months and still cant get the smile off my face The only negative is the interior The plastic is cheap but the overall car makes up for it The car is a headturner  Big bang for the buck Roomy enough for two and space for luggage Great styling inside and out Constantly get positive comments on redfire color and 20 wheels and tires Great handling and breaking Acceleration is great and lays rubber on command Great rumble from dual exhaustsmay upgrade to Ford racing exhaust Worth every penny of 31000 price tag  I always take the long way to work  That sums up my experience with the car There has only been one problem in over a year of ownership and that was the top Ford fixed it under the EXTENDED warranty Really surprised me and was much appreciated considering what Ive heard from others about Ford  Awesome looks sounds great faster than 99 of cars on the road been super reliable 281 cubes and American muscle My former Acura was nothing in performance and reliability compared to this Goes to show if you treat a car right and maintain it properly itll love you back People gripe about the fake scoops but look at 6070s muscle cars and tons have fake scoops too I love em  I love my pony I ordered a Windveil blue convertible with parchment top and leather interior same color with comfort package new for 2007 Also added an interior upgrade I wanted to brighten up the inside as much as possible not a big fan of black but the black that is there looks great Oh Pony package of course This car is awesome She gets looks everywhere she goes So much fun with the top down My salesman said to order the boot that goes over the top when its down It helps keep it clean when the top is down for an extended period of time  Its also expensive to add the hardware for it to the car if you decide you want it later  If you have cats invest in a car cover  Have waited a long time to find a ragtop which was not driven into the ground by a youthful driver If you are lucky enough to find one as I did adult owned by only 2 owners it is a GREAT car to drive and performance is very good  This is a great car to cruise in to commute in and to have fun being bad in  The power and the sound of the throaty exhaust will always put a smile on your face  Therapists should have very little business from owners of this vehicle  It looks great handles surprisingly well and has power to spare  My only regret is that I did not buy this car a year ago  I have owned my 2002 Mustang GT Convertible now for about 18 months It consistently outperforms the hottest of import sports cars even those advertising 3040 more horsepower Gas mileage is a pleasant surprise 1820 in town 2527 on the highway The car is not really tightly built but it holds up well even under hard use The sum total of the pieces add up to a car that is quick fast exciting and fun to drive and turns heads wherever it goes I could not have done better with my money  I have owned many Mustangs from a 66GT 85GT 93LX 99GT and a 91 GT that I traded on this car This is far and away a better designed and assembled car The automatic transmission in this car is the best shifting overdrive Ford transmission yet It accelerates and shifts very fast for a stock car yet is smooth when driving normally The power top is quiet and goes up and down quickly The controls are laid out well and everything is within the drivers reach The stereo is the Shaker and sounds okay speaker placement is difficult in a convertible but could be improved with the upgrade to the 1000 The fit and finish is the best Ive seen from Ford No matter where you go people stare  The car drives like a big heavy American car Nostalgia like a Moms car but is hot and sharp at the same time  It feels very safe and is exciting the way it holds the road and has pick up like most V8s  The dash could be a little more Mercedesish but I like the chrome and design  Great speakers and upgraded music system  Pretty bad on fuel economy  One hot car 5th  gear is only used after 60  It is amazing that at 80 it is turning just 2000 rpm  No joke  I took a trip at 60 to 70 mph and got 228 mpg Most times I get right around 19 to 20 mpg  It is very difficult to find information about this car  How many were manufactured  HPWEIGHT ratio How much are the commemorative medallions valued at  I have six of them  I have special wheels bought from a noted tire dealer  I have been offered 250 or more for the original alloy rims  Why are they worth anything at all  3 people have offered me at least that much money  I used to own a classic Mustang convertible  This car is just like it except this car has better steering no dead spot in the steering doesnt shake going over bumps has a great radio top doesnt leak cowl doesnt leak no more wet carpet windows dont rattle and yes the gauges all work  All in all this car has all the great styling I remember with none of the bad things I had tried to forget  while i do not drive my mustang far when i do dirve it it gets stares and it is exciting to get on the gas   When I first test drove this car I was truly amazed at the way it performed  I had been driving SUVs for many years and the thought of a rearwheel drive car was unrealistic  It handles extremely well its sharp looking Im always getting compliments on it and it truly is fun to drive I am completely sold  This V6 is surprisingly fast I am sorry its not the GT but price was prohibitive Mainly use this on weekends when top down driving is the most fun I like the fact that the V6 exhaust has a pleasant sound although Im told switching to the right side GT muffler will improve the sound Wont sound like a V8 but a more throaty sound none the less Im considering it but my selling dealer says a different muffler could void the engine warranty I dont buy that but Im afraid to take the chance Maybe after the warranty expires  I have driven the mustang GT for 4 months It is an absolute blast to drive The fuel economy is not as well as I had hoped  I bought a 2005 Premium Convertible  My first car Ive bought on my own  So far Ive had it in twice for the fuel pump and Im taking it in to get the top replaced because the rear defroster stopped working  Ive had the gear shifter replaced in it  Im not happy camper with this car  If it wasnt for all these problems Id absolutely love this car  Rides great minus the time it stopped running on the middle of I95  Love driving with the top down love the audio in it  Maybe I just got a bad pony  But I wont ever buy a Ford again the service is awful  Ive owned this car for just over 3 months and have had nothing but problems The car has been out of service for almost 40 days Just got the car back from the dealer on Friday they had it for 26 consecutive days and cant fix a clickingpopping sound in the front end Called Ford technical service and are sending a tech in on 110106 to look at the car The headliner is falling out now held in place with cardboard shims rear axle bearings and seals replaced front and rear rotors already turned rear quarter windows replaced because of rusty screws holding the weather strips parking break lever replaced finish coming of the chrome ac vent rocker moldings loose and the list goes on  My mother has a 6 banger 04 My 06 pony package is far superior in every category not taking into account fuel Yeah I have a lead foot With a GT I would be in jail as speeding is way too easy with the Pony  The handling is nice for such a heavy car but for the money you cant beat it  Be ready for some road noise but get the Shaker sound system and youll never notice it  Ive only put 5000 miles on it but havent had a single problem other than the frequent compliments     I have never spoken with more strangers or had more people talk cars with me than when I started driving this 05 Mustang GT convertible last year  It has called for so much attention because of its incredible beauty It has awesome power and iI never fear pulling out at intersections anymore because NOW I KNOW I can make the turn without getting in someones way I GO  She goes  Entering and exiting military posts has guards drooling over this gorgeous retro Stang  With the top down folks pull up beside me and start chatting about it I just wish I had bought this earlier in the year to enjoy it longer  I enjoy driving the Mustang except for a whining noise from the manual transmission in 5th gear and pulling positive torque  No noise when not under acceleration or slowing down  This is my third Mustang and the previous 88 and 95 both with the 5 speed manual did not make any noise like this  The dealership mechanic and the owner of the dealership both drove the car and both acknowledge the noisy gear whine but Ford wants more info from them comparing the noise with another new 5 speed manual transmission in another car  This transmission was flawed right from the first mile and should have been immediately repaired or replaced  Needless to say I am very disappointed with Ford and their quality  What a great raw muscle car Fast throaty acceleration  Easy to use controls  Drawbacks are the lumbar or lack of support and the slight interior noise from the mini window on the drivers side    I bought my 07 last July  It is the best car I have ever owned  It has superb handling great accelerationa terrific rumble from its V8 and twin pipes wonderful stability at even VERY high speeds and one of the best enginetransmission combos I have seen in any car domestic or imported  and its got that great retro Mustang look  If American car makers would build all their cars as they have this one the imports would be in full retreat  I bought it for my wife and havent let her touch it  This car has been an absolute dream to own and drive  For a woman who has always loved Mustangs this is possibly a perfect match  The handling is great for cruising it really hugs the curves  All 300 horses given the room to run performs wonderfully  For people who love to listen to tunes the system cant be beat  Once owned 68 Firebird convertible and recently turned 40 and couldnt resist This is a nice and fun reproduction of the original I bought the Pony Package V6 convertible in Windveil Blue and am very happy with it A good value vehicle for the money  Bought the Mustang for looks and performance Not disappointed with handling acceleration and oh the sound My only two complaintsthe seat belt receiver is hard to reach and the interior easily scratches  This car is the most exciting fun vehicle I have ever owned  It turns heads with its styling and not only performs well off the line and accelerating at higher speeds as well as taking off ramps but also with the fantastic sound system  Ive always wanted a retro style Mustang and now that Ive got it I couldnt be happier  Excellent handling and enough power in the V6 that you dont need to drop the extra for the V8  Seat belts are tight but that adds to the sports carpower feel  I have people stop me almost every day to compliment my car Wouldnt have gotten it without the Pony package  Just adds exactly what is needed to make this one incredible machine  As I am fast approaching my 60th birthday it is nowhere near as fast as the 49 seconds it takes this Mustang GT to reach 60  Telling ya I have been driving Ford trucks and SUVs for over thirty years and finally I bought a vehicle for the pure fun of driving it When you crank it up the first thing you sense is a low rumbling growl generated from a 300HP OHC engine  By the time you put it into 4th gear you are going 70MPH at 2000 RPM  Thats power  Add a little Rolling Stones on the Shaker 500 sound system and life takes on a whole new glow      For what is really an inexpensive car I have had more fun driving daily than any other vehicle I have ever owned  The level of performance that is available right off the showroom floor for 30k cannot even be contemplated by any other car  Throw in the fact that Ford understands and embraces the aftermarket phenomenon for Mustangs and that the car is built for addons and it can be a fun hobby  Spend an extra 10k in upgrades and you have a car that challenges Porches and blows away Corvettes  Great job on this one Ford now work on the rest of your line  On a warm summer day top down music blasting yet you can still hear the rumble of the V8 engine  When you put your foot into the throttle it jumps like a thoroughbred race horse  Theres nothing like cruising with the top down  Be sure to tell your wife to adjust the seat so she can depress the clutch all the way to floor for each shift and for starting car Frantic call 1 Car wont start  Frantic call 2 Rear windows are down and I do not know how to make them go up Frantic call 3 overhead light wont go off and rear windows are down again Explained the lights will go off automatically after you exit the door and showed her the little buttons to turn offon individual lights Also explained button that makes top go up and down and if pushed will make rear windows go down Why didnt I tell her before I had to sell the 5 speed and thought the AC and rear defrost and electric seats was a success  All my life I wanted a Mustang and Im glad I waited till now to buy it The mix of the old body style in and out sold me on this model Handles like a sports car should road hugging smooth that pulls threw any curve Power is more than enough there may be faster but I dont see people breaking their necks to look at the grandma styled competitors Going top down is an experience everyone should have From 6 to 6o year olds Ive had them all point and compliments abound   This car is junk  The quality of this vehicle is so substandard that they left a 3 unsealed seam that lets water in causing electrical system failures and the car to become such a mildewed mold covered stinking mess that Ford dealers wont even take the car as trade in Not an isolated incident Search 20052007 MUSTANG LEAKS and watch what you find  Ford finds this kind of defect acceptable They will patch it and send you on your way regardless of any other damage that might have occurred If you anticipate customer service and any assistance from Ford dont hold your breath  These cars come with a taillight warranty when they cant see your taillights your warranty is over  What a great car Tons of speed a roomy interior great sound system and good mileage  The convertible top is a cinch to operate And the car is a real headturner Expect to get a lot of attention when youre driving one of these   I will be 70 in March and my wife of 46 years will be 6939 in September 2007  My wifes friends at Curves Gym drive convertibles and we had a GT PT Cruiser that was boring us to death So we went looking for something to make us feel younger and have something we can have for years to come 5 speed 300hp  The car is a 10 Mileage beats our Cruiser in city and highway  GO FOR IT  Went from an 04 GT to an 07 GT convertible The difference is amazing Ride performance and comfort are much improved I dont want to get out  I am a FordLincoln Mercury Tech for 38 years I have owned three Lincoln Mercury MKVIII s and compared to this Mustang Ford missed the mark  The handling is not near as good compared to the MKVIII I have taken curves on a every day basis at high speeds and the Mustang will feel loose in the rear end This is due to the live axle The Mustang is a fun car and quick but would have better handling with an independent suspension But all in all this is a very fun car to drive for a 58 year old young man Note  the Mustang will pass just about everything except a GAS STATION   In 2 weeks the honeymoon is not over Just starting the engine lets you know this car rocks Distinctive sound is like Barry White  deep vibrant and powerful Performance with 18 tires is superb Five speed shifting is smooth and solid Front seats are extremely comfortable and supportive Not a squeak or rattle  very tight Couldnt find a defect on delivery The gauge display is pure retro but the color options are an up to date touch Driving has never been this much fun  I have had many muscle car convertibles in the past and didnt realize how much I missed them until I took the Mustang for a test drive The old cars especially with the prices they are currently demanding dont have anything on this car The ride handling and performance are awesome and I wouldnt even think twice before making a cross country trip with this car Unfortunately I live in the great white north so my baby is put away for the winter But since I put it away I have been busy installing the Ford Racing power pack cant wait to drive it with the 325hp I will have in Spring  I have always bought Fords but this one is junk I garage and care for my car Serviced only through Ford I do not beat on this thing and for some unknown reason 1 The battery dies 2 Car decides to stop running 3 Brakes lock up My next car is a Toyota If Ford goes belly up after 5 years they brought it on themselves  I had always wanted a GT so when they were running some rebates I went for it  No regrets since The only problem Ive had with it is a nut coming loose on one of the top drive cylinders which I was able to fix myself  I cant get enough of the power and sound even in stock form  After leaving it with my Dad for a year while I was overseas I wasnt out of the driveway before I said to myself This is a fast car  I also think its better looking than the new one but thats just me  Its no wonder Chevy couldnt sell Camaros the Mustang is just about perfect  No frills just fun    Ive had this car for 2 years and its amazing  Its everything youd expect from 6 cylinders and a little more  And it turns heads everywhere I go    The car reminds me of a Porsche I owned Most stable performance from a convertible no less I like the long throw shift better on this car than a 2007   Well my mom got this Mustang in 03 for a real good deal Its one of a kind black w white top and white leather Now I drive it mostly and I have to say it is fun It is quite poor at low rps however when its up there its really up there Had tranny problems and power widow control sank into door Fog lights are constant problem Back seat is nonexistent and front is uncomfortable Stereo is awesome though other than above mentioned problems this car seems quite reliable  Startup sound makes you swoon Exterior styling is perfect Interior comfort front seats only is impeccable Performance is fabulous As you can tell this car is all about emotion  I drove it to Florida in late November with plans to stop halfway for the night But the car was so much fun to drive that I kept going Twenty hours later I reached my destination and still wanted to keep driving  Of the 51 vehicles that have passed through my hands in the last thirtyfive years this is the most enjoyable  Note With only 8300 miles and being stored during the winter I cannot truthfully report on longerterm reliability  Had a GT 20 years ago was fun to drive then even more fun now Convertibles are a blast like riding a motorcycle but more comfortable the V8 power is awesome can easily spin the tires Seats and position are comfortable back seat is fine for kids only Handles quick a little light in the rear though The tops wear out and run 400800 Real fun to drive turns heads Plenty of power  Fun like it was 30 years ago Fast reliable Much better handling Ride is stiff for old joints  This car has been so wonderful to drive I bought the car with 34k miles It now has over 120k and still runs great The only major expense has been to replace the top  I would recommend this car to anyone  First off I overpaid for the car by about 23k Which wouldnt be a problem because I love the design of the car and the constant attention it gets But the car loses value at an unacceptable rate Its honestly sickening its been sitting in my garage for 4 months and its lost over 2k in value   Ive had my stang for about a year Living in the north east its garaged for the winter but spring is only a month away  I cant wait to park my Jeep and get back out in my Mustang   Its taken 12 years but I finally got another Mustang  I enjoy everything about this car the feel of driving it shifting everything  Ford did an amazing job at building this car but there are some drawbacks but those were to keep the cost down  The best yet for Mustangs Beautiful and powerful Much improved  seating and noise Unbelievable Shaker 1000  I bought this Mustang in Feb of 2004 with only 52000 miles on it  It already had the 60000 miles work done on it  Since then Ive driven it to about 88000 miles   It performs great  good acceleration and decent cornering though I rarely push either  The top very rarely leaks only when Ive driven in BIG storms  Its only happened twice  This is a big improvement over my last convertible a 92 Mustang  The only problems Ive had are that the cruise control button fell off one day last year its still usable and the front brakes have needed A LOT of work 1300  They always cover the front rims with brake dust as well  Overall Im very happy with the car  I wasnt looking for a Mustang and have never been a big fan I saw this 7 year old vehicle with less than 55k miles while looking at other convertibles I gave it a try because of the low price and was really impressed I actually liked the handling better than Mustang GT convertibles Id driven I was surprised by how powerful the V6 felt with the 5 speed manual My particular car must have spent a lot of time in the garage based on the low mileage tight feel and nearly flawless interior and exterior I thought Id miss the quick openclose of the top that I had with a Miata but this power top is fast and seems well made On the road the blue color seems one of the least common  I really am satisfied with my new car It drives and handles like a much more expensive car Love the Windevil Blue and Parchment color  I bought this car as a present to myself for getting my graduate degree Im a single mom and so tired of being practical My kids and I love cranking the music and putting the top down There are a few small things Id change but I have so much fun with this car Even ordered a vanity plate   My Mustang GT California Special is more than I expected and has plenty of power and rides great The 3 valve engine just keeps pulling and the suspension is smooth and tight The California package is worth the price and I love the car  The quality is superb the interior comfy back seats a bit tight This thing is super I highly recommend that anyone looking for a convertible test drive this car last Fully decked out it was still 8000 less than the EOS and the convertible top is flawless  You might like the looks of the Vette as we have from the outside but here the looks are inside too great seating and be careful for that accelerator pedal  Excellent all round fun to drive car Our V6 is equiped with the optional Pony package This really helps out in the handling dept with added rear anti sway bar ABSand 17 alloy rims Take one for a drive Youll love it  The 2004 Anniversary Convertible is the way to go to celebrate your mid life crisis The styling is sleek and the sonic blue is a classly color with twin 10 silver bumper to bumper stripes The V6 has more than enough power and the automatic shifts extremely smooth The convertible top is quiet at highway speeds and is so simple to raise and lower The bucket seats are firm and there is enough leg room and head room Forget about the back seats being comfortable they are there for looks only not for carrying passengers But heck the Stang is for having fun for two The interior is well designed and controls are easy to reach and use The fit and finsh is better than some more expense car  When they stopped making the Trans Ams in 2002 I never thought Id get the sport convertible I always wanted Then the new body style Mustangs came out in 05 and I secretly craved one for my driveway  After biting the bullet and admitting that I loved this Ford despite it being a Ford Ive got one It is an amazing ride and there is nothing like the feel of the wind blowing through your hair at 80 MPH on the interstate Watch out though  Its very easy to just keep right on accelerating and never even notice I had it up to 100 and it felt just as smooth and sturdy as at 65 Overall the Mustang is a good buy  I love this car It is very fun to drive and it is very stylish All of my friends love my car It is very reliable and I have never had any trouble with it It never leaks because of the top and the top comes down very quick  Great car at a lower than expected price lots of powerhandles very wellcar still a favorite of many onlookers even when compared to new styling some prefer it to the retro look It is also a car well supported by the aftermarket suppliers so custom accessories abound Happy with mine after three years of ownership  I bought a convertible before I got too old to appreciate it and Im glad I did My grandkids complain Im too old to be driving such a hot car Car is an absolute blast to drive head and shoulders better than my 2000 GT coupe Car looks super with top down and I frequently get compliments Power top has been troublefree no leaks to date Biggest issue I have is interior squeaksrattles I never had with my 2000 GT which are annoying when top is up Shaker 500 stereo is nice but Im not sure speakers are suited to it Rear defrost switch is in awkward position hard to operatesee when in 5th gear Using cupholders can make shifting awkward Still a tremendous value super to drive  I just bought a 2007 Mustang V6 which is my first new car and a serious step up from my old beater I absolutely love the way it looks and its a blast to drive The interior looks great and is very comfortable with only 2 exceptions Having a manual tranny I find the cupholders are not very good and the car really need an overhead handle on the passenger side Other than that the car is great Its fun to drive looks great and is still resonably roomy for a sports car  I bought this car a year and a half ago with 24000 miles now it has a bit over 50000 Absolutely no mechanical issues to date Always starts right up even in the dead cold of winter Plenty of power for a V6 and gas mileage is good for a V6 I was wary to buy a Ford after owning an 1989 Escort in the past that was garbage but this car looked so shiny and lonely when I first saw it just pleading to be driven and I fell in love with it Its such a pleasure to drive especially with the top down Its a real head turner too I always get complements on it I highly recommend this car and would definately buy another Mustang in the future Take car of it and it will take care of you  Incredibly fun to drive and comfortable Acceleration is exhilirating and stopping performance is above expectations  High performance better than average fuel economy Still a tight package on the interior needs a little more shoulder and hip room Handling is very good Plenty of power on tap when you need it  I love this car I get looks and comments everywhere from total strangers and they all love the design and performance Vista blue is an awesome color with the white stripe Fit and finish is great I test drove a Solstice Pontiac G6 and a Mitsubishi Spyder convertible This car blows them all away and is cheaper to boot It also has a trunk thats pretty darn large and a back seat that is adequate I am getting between 21 and 25 mpg and have plenty of power  First had a 67 and of course regret ever getting rid of it Bought this as a leftover in December 06 for a steal loaded with rebates dealer concessions etc  Best buy in a car ever  Solid as a rock  Fast and the sweetest engine rumble  Handles exceptionally well and goes almost as quick as my supercharged 01 Jag XKR  Rougher more raw power but it adds to fun  Amazingly solid for a conv   A truly fantastic value with auto premium everything etc  Great car  Tempts me to get rid of my Jag and match this conv with an 08 fully loaded GT coupe  Purchased the car privately about 6 weeks ago and have had a blast with it since  A few road trips taken my 2 boys and their friends for rides just a real fun experience Ive had about a dozen cars and even a few trucks revving engines and wanting to race Also had lots of comments on the nice ride one fellow with a PT cruiser convertable even made an offer to buy it at a stop light  I had a 77 Cobra back when and I have to admit you really can go back with this car  If you want to have fun you cant really go wrong with this ride   Couldnt wait for the Camaro so I bought a Mustang GT convertible  I am not greatly impressed with the 300 HP  I would have bought a Shelby except for the 25K upcharge  This car is the love of my life Unfortunately the Colorado State Police pay way too much attention to it too  I bought a 5 speed  cant imagine driving an automatic When I want to pass someone on our mountain roads I leave them in my dust  by the way  Im a baby boomer lady I love the shift throw  have no problem with the clutch I do wish the CD changer digital readout was easier to see  My only problem with this car is the convertible lock down system  I also drive on some bumpy dirt roads  the convertible top shakes  shimmys more than it should  There are also some serious blind spots to watch for I love my mag wheels  the Bullet sound Not much winter driving tho  I have been driving a 2001 GT convertible for a few years and fell in love with the new model once I saw the design however the design is only the tip of the iceberg  This is a much better car than the SN95 version its faster the transmission doesnt feel like a pickups my girlfriend can push down the clutch and its no longer a rattlebox  The car keeps pulling through 4th gear and doesnt feel like youre inside of a B17s nacelle over Germany like the old one did  This is a very comfortable car and no longer feels like the boy racer my 2001 was  That was a very solid car but the new model is in a new class its a grownups car that makes you feel like youre 16  After searching all the competitors out there including the German and Japanse cars how could anyone not consider a Mustang I bought a GT convertible Wow for the money this car has no peer Right out of the box the power and handling of this car are fantastic To think I can get addon accessories to boost this performance to even higher levels without breaking the bank is even better Top down driving is fun Your passengers in the back may ask you to roll up the windows on the freeway but in the front seats the wind is manageable The family loves the car and want to take it everywhere Four seats Great stereo with excellent bass response Very comfortable seats Im over 6 too  This car has only one problem The space on the speedometer between 55 and 80 is to thin You will get into trouble if you dont keep an eye on your speed No rattles squeaks or defects  As for the ownership experience this car was built on August 8th and was not delivered until October 7th    I had an attack of patriotism so I had to buy American also 3rd midlife crisis More comfortable than I would have imagined corners great and I love the sound A little clunky but hey its a Ford Fast enough that you have to watch the speedometer I drove from Idaho to NY and averaged 70 MPH I got 24 MPG on regular gas Whats not to like A lot of fun for the money  Just bought a new Mustang to get back in her good graces after selling the 64 12 that was too dangerous for the family  Wow the car is great  I cant remember the last time when I bought something and thought it was worth 4050 more than I paid  Why cant Detroit make more cars like this I hate buying German but generally they are superior Lots of fun  A head turner at this price  I just bought a 2006 GT Conv with 13000 miles  Ive had it two days and already love it  My other vehicle is a Mazda CX9 for the family  This one is fun for me and I can still haul the family for fun trips  With the GT V8 Im surprised that Im averaging 2023 mpgnot bad considering the 300 horses and irresitible urge to nail it and nail it and well you get the point  Buy this vehicle  If  are tight I recommend an 06 or 07great bargains out there  I personally chose a used GT instead of a new V6  I would have considered a used 05 but I never get a car its first year in productionno idea if theres any real basis in that just my personal hangup  I purchased my Mustang about 2 years ago in Florida and then moved back north  This car has been wonderfully reliable taking me to and from Florida  My only complaint regarding long trips is that the drivers seat is horribly uncomfortable and I really get poor gas mileage  Until recently I havent had any problems with the car  Lately the convertible top back near the window has been leaking and now I am dealing with wet floors  I think it is mostly due to the Florida sun drying out the top for 5 years since it was never garage kept I get tons of compliments though    Just purchased this car after 3 years of deciding wheather to get one Love the new design and got a great deal so I went ahead I have been so pleased with the way this car makes me feel how it drives and the awesome power at my fingertips The stereo and some features are great  Love my Emily   Being a Euro car snob I was more than surprised with how much I liked my wifes midlife crisis car The new Mustangs have everything I always liked about American cars and none of the problems The convertible is quiet dry easy to use and little buffeting compared to other convertibles The car handles extremely well it is very controllablepredictable on the track and well balanced The power is amazing but what would I know I used to drive a Fiat By far the biggest surprise with this car is how comfortable the car is on long trips I can drive 800 miles and feel great when I get out So far I get 187 mpg overall which is okay considering the power and automatic transmission   I have to say how surprised I am that after owning my Mustang for over six months I still smile every time I drive it The looks the feel the way it handles all top notch   This is the 3rd 6 cyl Mustang Ive owned and this one is by far my favorite The fit and finish is great the performance is so far beyond my 95 that its closer to the fox body v8 I like it so much that this is the first Stang that Im upgrading visualy and performance wise Thats saying something about the passion this car causes in me as my first Stang was purchased in 1973 My only complaint would be the fuel fill problem that occurs once in awhile the tank wont take a fill up at times Overall all I can say is that it kills me from Nov to April when I store it   It has been 20 years since I owned a stick shift  I forget how much fun driving can be That is if you get into a mustang GT Great powerlooks an awesome sound system This car is just an incredible car to drive For the money you cannot buy this power good looks and a vehicle this fun to drive I looked into buying Mustangs in the past but did not do so because of the rough ride This cars ride and handling are that of much more expensive cars with much less to offer If you are looking for a start of the art computer based car this is not it but if you are looking for retro styling with updated technology this is the car for you  Best Mustang ever  Ride Hhndling and interior are super  real bank for the buck when compared to some more refined but much more expensive vehicles  350Z is nice  but doesnt have space to put a brief case  not as much fun and doesnt get the attention that the Mustang draws  V8 Power is fast fast fast  great powerband  torque everywhere  you could practically drive it in 3rd  The fun factor of driving this car is off the charts The engine with the cold air intake is the sweetest sounding engine that you have ever heard with a low high pitched whistle  Get the seat warmer option and you can drive it with the top down over 40 degrees  I picked it up in Tampa and the 8 hours I spent driving it home was as much fun as a man can have with his clothes on  Handling is superb and the front seats are extremely comfortable with the ability to actually lean your head back on the head rest to prevent fatigue  Very pleased and happy with the purchase a month into the ride   I was waiting for a car like this my whole life  I love it  The ripping engine sound the style the interior  The new traction control the old Mustangs lacked    I love this GT This is my first GT convertible I wasnt looking for this style mustang when I firsted started but this car caught my eye and I couldnt past it up Def wont stay shock for long I def have one of the fastest cars in the town Not to make cars will smoke this car Definitely worth all the money I paid for it   Just purchased this car 2 weeks ago to relieve my midlife crisis I was smiling all the way home driving it with the top down This car is all I expected and more Probably not the most comfortable ride for some its not a Lexus but this is more of a sports car and I do like the feel of the road coupled with the 5 speed manual transmission Amazing pickup very easy to go way over the speed limit seems to always want to go faster gas mileage not bad for a GT Leather buckets are comfy Have always had good luck with Fords Im hoping this one will also be as reliable   I bought this car for 17000 from a blonde girl who owned for only 9 months and only 11000 miles The reason im saying this is because she bought a MB CLK coupe with 45000 miles for 30000 Go figure I love this silver convertible mustang since the very first day The car looks great I added 20 black wheels and lowered 2 People on the street always stare I have owned this car since Dec 2000 The only thing that I have change on this car is the oil and brakes once Oh I also upgraded the headlights to all clear and smoke the tailights The car has 105k miles and I will keep it for many more years The car has been super reliable   Im 70 yrs old and this is the car I have been waiting for So much fun to drive Mine is dark candy apple red with parchment top Always good comments Boy could I have gotten into a lot trouble if I had something like this in school  I picked up my 2008 V6 Premium convertible this past Monday Very pleased so far I have a fully loaded car with the exception of NAVI Very comfy ride altho you will feel the bumps Very comfy and supportive seats V6 has plenty of pickup auto transmission Cant speak to reliability yet of course Dont know how good the fuel economy will be but I dont really care because its a fun car that probably wont be used all year round Too cold to put the top down yet unfortunately   We purchased this car one year old and it has been fantastic in reliability and retro style Love the convertable roof stereo is very good shaker 500 and the car drives extremely well We traded a very unreliable and quirky Mazda rx8 for this car and every time I turn the key the Mustang jumps to life and is eager to run The car handles very well considering its size and gives the driver a confident feel of the road always in control A 1500 mile trip to the coast turned in 26 mpg which is great considering the HPSize way better than the RX8 too In town average is around 18 mpg  My Legend Lime V6 convertible has been a wonderful experience I bought it instead of a motorcycle due to 2 little ones at home because it has a back seat  I drove it to Illinois by myself from Minnesota the first week I bought it and put the cruise on with the top down and tunes cranked  I havent had one repair It is hands down the best value for a sports car  I had 2 69 Stangs growing up and this one hasnt let me down for performance  Bought with 7k miles now at 26k no major problems just the same tail lamp keeps burning out Allcity driving yields terrible gas mileage but cruising on hwy at 70mph I get 28mpg easy Installed AirAid conical air filter which made huge difference in throttle response power and exhaust note In 2nd gear at 3000 rpm watch out Very fast Fullsize luggage can fit in trunk something most convertibles cant boast Stereo is amazingly powerful even on hwy wroof down Brakes could be better Bumpy roads reveal rattles and looseness mainly in windows  roof But for combo of V8 power stickshift control topless motoring mega style and storage space theres no competition at all  Where do I start I bought this car with 14000 miles In feb 07 a month later I had it back to the dealer for the paint coming off the bumper Got that fixed 2 weeks later my school books where soaking wet I left my bookbag in the trunk I thought the top was leaking but after 8 trips to dealer with the car being there for as many 30 days to get it back with same each time we cant find the major leak I have come to the conculsion that it is leaking from the weld in the body Back to body problems the Mustang stripe has come off 2 times I finally got tired of the dealer being so blind to the problem I called a lemon law lawyer so now I have a pending lawsuite against Ford For all my trouble  We bought the car new 206 By August had trouble fueling it Ford said some cars are hard to put gas in They did nothing about Will not do anything about it even under warranty For me it cured me of ever owning a Ford again Much less a mustang  Grew up always wanting a 70 Mustang GT fastback Finally I am fortunate to buy a toy and was happy to purchase a convertible that is this much fun to drive I get such a rush from hearing the engine rumble on Car has power I needed to get my sports car fix It is toy for me but I am going to drive it more than originally planned I hope my Mercedes and Jaquar dont get jealous  When the new design Mustang came out in Â’05 Â– I just loved the looks Well I decided to build one just the way I wanted and ordered an 06 GT convertible with every option except the auto trans how dare you  and the 1000 watt stereo I wanted as much truck space as possible  Well I love it The build quality is great The performance is exhilarating And it is always fun fun fun A few issues were taken care of by the dealer  he bent over backwards to them make right  The car just works  And looks great doing it  IÂ’m even surprised about how well the resale value has kept up   I have always wanted another Mustang since the 69 I had and I finally got it It is everything I hoped it would be So much fun to drive When Im out with the top down years and wrinkles melt away and Im young again All my friends want one now  Bought the car in 2005 with 33000 miles fun to drive but gets the same 2022 mpgin city or highway driving Needs on more high end gear ratio so car doesnt stop when you take your foot off gas Interior quality is poor Automatic door lock dont work and the plastic trim is falling off I live in AZ and the air conditioner is very poor in hot weather Car overheats and a really big drag on the engine   I had been shopping around for convertibles and one day I happened to stumble upon this one Im glad I went with this car because it was probably the best convertible with a decent amount of performance Ive come across for my price range I have an automatic model and prefer a manual transmission but because this car is so much fun to drive and its my daily driver I dont mind not having control of the gears Ive only had the car for less than a week and bought it with 86000 miles so I cant say much about reliability It eats gas up in the city but you have to kind of expect that from a V8  I purchased the car with 1000 miles on it I have had zero problems with it Odometer reading is 15000 I drive it mostly in the summer with the top down Installed Ford racing headers x pipe exhaust and a hurst shifter This car is more fun than any man has a right to have  Ive just turned 30000 miles and have enjoyed each one of them No reliability issues Have only seen the dealer for routine service This car is my dailydriver rain shine or snow It has never failed to get me home even in the snow Ive added a strut tower brace and a moreefficient louder exhaust The exhaust seems to have helped the gasmileage avg 21 22mpg mixed cityfreeway It is a comfortable car to take a trip in and the 500 watt stereo is fine No squeaks or rattles  Ive always wanted a convertible now I have one The car is fun to drive very comfortable for a sports car and I am really suprised at how great the ride is I expected more road noise with the top up so I am pleasantly surprised at the lack of noise You can carry on a conversation with a passenger in normal tones with the top down Same goes for listening to the radio The V6 has plenty of power for an old guy like me late 40s and is pretty quick also  The limited editionbuild 2008 Bullitt Mustang is loaded with fun this car has great acceleration thanks to the 373 gears although it effects your mileage Ive been averaging about 17 mpg even though I put my foot into it with regularity Another nice thing in this day of high gas prices is that the vehicle runs on either premium or regular unleaded With regular unleaded you supposedly lose a little torque but I can tell you that you dont notice it A good compromise is the plus grade if available  It look me years and years to get my Mustang Wanted a 66 because of the body style but had to wait for the restore until my body style was available Love the car the gas mileage is ok with the tough gas prices lately but love the car   Loved the car Im 65 260 bodybuider frame and never felt crowded lots of legroom Usually got around 22 mpg per fiilup No problems Just got the fever for the new Jeep unlimited Sahara 4dr but will probably regret the trade  The 05 Mustang convertible in dark red with tan leather and premium interior is a fun to drive beautiful all American head turner It handles and sounds great for a V6 and its classic looks are terrific I grew up in Detroit in the 70s so I guess I am the target audience for the design and they hit the target  I bought this car in 2001 with 60k miles on the car My wife wanted a convertible and this car had a higher entry into the car than the GM F bodies So I work a good deal and drove it home Within 6 month I had to replace the alternator and battery No biggy About to months later the coil pack Well this went on about every 4 to 5 months Also within the first year I had to remove the intake and clean it because of carbon build up For use a poorly designed valve cover which lets engine gases escape into the PVC line At 120000 miles the head gasket blew and I had enough of this car breaking down The door windows hit the top when opening and closing 2005 got the better idea fix  This is a great car I love how it handles I have the automatic and it shifts smoothly and no real hesitation in regards to power I get an average of 19 mpg around town and got 25 mpg up in the mountains The V8 is powerful and easy to control the exhaust note is fantastic The California package is a good package for the money much better than the lame Shelby package  not the 500   I bought V6 5 speed red Mustang in 2005 and has 47k miles already No mechanicalelectrical issues Cons no real pick up in first gear tires of low quality poor track in winterrain conditions stereo of low quality keeps the cds inside some cabin noise reverse shift difficult to engage plastic interior of low quality cupholders useless in current location dings and bells for seat belts and other conditions extremely noisy and loud Pros almost everything else design speed comfort for 2 passengers of course trunk space fuel economy reliability etc    Ive only had Japanese or German cars but the Mustang has always stirred my interest a little despite my general disdain for American designThat is until this new body style came along I must admit that I warmed up to it quickly and before long I just had to have it I wanted a convertible actually did not mind a V6 and realized that since Im a family man now there are not a lot of choices out thereSolara anyone Or worse Eos The Mustang fit the bill Classic style  history raw power and seats 4 to boot Got the V8 who needs the radio when you have the rumble from the exhaust for entertainment Crazy torque handles well for its size and looks gorgeous with the top down  I have had this car for over a year now and I love it  It is fun to drive and gets respectable gas mileage for what it is However I have had several nonengine related mechanical issues  I have had to replace all 4 power windows this year and my Mach CD player broke and is expensive to fix  I have also had to fix the power window switch But the engine has been flawless If you want a simple fun convertible I highly recommend this car  I have owned classic hot rods from the 60s this is as much fun to drive with the comforts of new options This is my second Mustang GT convertible love it  I have owned this Mustang GT Black Convertible since 2003 It has never broken down or given me any trouble First had it in Germany and I could set the cruise control for 110mph and it would ride steady Added a set of flowmasters and KN air intake and it sounds amazing Trunk space is very small One time something was placed in the back window and I put the top down and the window shattered so be careful putting anything by the back window Gas mileage is fair about 250 miles on a 14gal tank about 18 MPG I could ride it a little easier but who really does Seat head rests are too low if you are 6ft tall and a little uncomfortable if you are tall Little back seat space Fun fun fun  Had my convertible now since May My 2 year old loves going for a top down ride The wife even likes it I love the car but it is nowhere near perfect and is about to get some serious competition  I bought my Mustang GT back in May of 01 and had the car till Feb of 08 This car was very well taken care of and I drove the car pretty crazy The only reason I kept it running so well is because my uncle is a mechanic so most of the problem were fixed by him I pumped regular gas in it but always used 1030 oil When it got to 75000 miles I started using 1030 high mileage mobil oil fully synthetic That was the best oil I used My car never leaked any oil because I always replaced any gaskets or seals that needed replacing Changed all the normal wear  tear stuff Always kept the car original except for the flowmasters When I ran a smog check  it had better results than a brand new Mustang  Lifelong owner of sport sedans from Far East or Europe Living out a childhood vision of owning a sports car with a great American V8 Car is engineered around the powerful engine not much else Unlike products from other domestic makers the understated styling and lack of cheezy exterior addon is quite appealing Obviously this is a recreational vehicle so it does not dissappoint great engine sound accelaration is pretty linear and suspension is a good compromise Not meant to make social statement so no complaints about 15 to 24 mpg Overall not a perfect car and not for everyone but just a fun personal toy to have in your garage  I bought this car a few months back and I am just in love with it Being a V6 I was expecting very little power but after a cold air intake an exhaust and a short throw shifter this thing is fast I would recommend this car to anyone  Ive driven 2 Altimas  a Corolla before this vehicle Big step up in fun factor and performance I dont know of any speedy chic autos that can compare to Mustang convertibles when it comes to price Im glad I have it and am seriously considering buying a GT in the future Ford please dont change the body style Id like to see the interior improved but most people who are aware of Mustang realize that cheap interior is par for the course Besides that would increase the price Some small mishaps occurred in year 1 the windows malfunctioned at times the trunk light went loose the turn signal had problems Driving out to the beach is a blast Better than a Sebring or Solara   I have been wanting a Mustang since I rented twice on business trips over the past few years The car is just 100 fun to drive and own People smile when you pass by and my kids think Dad is the coolest The car handles well for an solid axle performance car The ride is not rock hard but firm Gas mileage is actually decent getting between 1925 mpg if you keep a light foot Push the pedal and watch the car go If you need even more power get the 500 HP Shelby GT500 This will do the job on your Hemi Challenger and the new Camaro The 18 rims and tires are a must they fill out the wheel wells nicely Shaker 500 audio is almost audiophile quality Have fun   I work downtown Los Angeles and park at the country club with all sorts of exotic cars let alone your M6s S8s etc but the valet guys favor my car The people from GAS Pimp my ride spruced it up with 20 inch Boss wheels Bassani exhaust cold air in take computer chip and Eibach lowered suspension In all Ive spent an extra 10k on extras and it was well worth it  This care simply cant sit still and its made to gun it with a mighty roar Id only wish I would have used the 1200 bucks for the stereo and gotten an aftermarket system   This is my first Ford I am a GM man I wanted a sports car convertible made in America This was my only choice  I dont understand why Ford doesnt make Mustangs stock that is high performance Yes you can purchase from Saleen Rouch etc with all the goodies why not from Ford at least as options I added a hurst shifter chrome 20 wheels side stripes things to make it look better I must admitt I do get a lot of Nice Car comments Probably because I have over 100 coats of wax on it Mine is a candy apple red I do love the sound system I wished they had a hood scoop on my car even though it was a fake It does look good I purchased this car off the lot My Camaro was fast  Ive only had it for a few months now but I can honestly say its by far my favorite car Its luxurious and sporty at the same time while still living up to its muscle car reputation Very comfortable seats and great overall design I get compliments everywhere I go With 260 horsepower and so many aftermarket options this car is great for both everyday driving and taking to the track This car is an American classic and once you drive one youll understand why Its a must have I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants the best of both worlds in an automobile  I love this car I have the 5 speed automatic and it performs without trouble Sure the gas mileage isnt that great but really who would expect that from a muscle car The only trouble is the really noisy top latches The rattle like crazy with the top up At first no rattles but as the weeks went by the latches were rattling like crazy Ford replaced them and they were fine for a while now they are rattling again   This is a really fun car to drive  One thing that helped this car tremendously in handling was an Eibach lowering kit  before lowering it the car would get some serious body roll in the turns After lowering it I sacrificed some of the cushy ride but owning a Mustang isnt about being cushy The delayed throttle response due to the flybywire technology is a little strange to get used to but can be compensated for by adding a hydrogen assist kit  supposed to help with gas mileage and it does by about 12 mpg but in this car with a tune it actually added about 1215 hp which seems to all come in during the low rpms improving throttle response and the seat of your pants launch  I really miss my car Someone just hit and ran me in a head on collision It looked like a small fender bender but after the mechanic looked at it they said the bar the transmission is attached to really bent Making this car totaled I am so sad I loved it Bought it new and drove it for 10 years Would have lasted forever had this not happened And it was beautiful I like it much better than the newer models Sad sad day for me  Too good looking to pass up always wanted a muscle car A blast to drive and love the burble of the exhaust Agree with other comments that 1st is too short and 5th too tall Gas mileage seems to vary wildly for no particular reason from 1117 around town Prehistoric technology that makes me smile  I have had many convertibles and sports cars and my GT is right up there with the best ever for all around fun and value I also have not had many vehicles that get so many people coming over to check it outa real eye pleaser    I have owned a few Mustangs and typically leave the exterior plain and spend the time and effort on modifying the engine and suspension My wife and I both saw a 2008 Bullitt in the Highland Green and were immediately drawn to the cars understated simplicity of styling that made the cars we loved as teenagers such classics Then I drove one  The changes are subtle from the 2006 GT I have been driving for 3 years but the suspension is firmer and the shifter is more precise The power difference negligible over the GT but the car just looks and sounds right  If you grew up driving V8 muscle cars in the 60s and 70s or wanted to and couldnt afford to this is your car  I had wanted a Mustang since my teen years and bought one 30 years later I bought the base model I havent had any trouble with it since purchasing Has great get up and go I love shifting gears  Holds the road great and that says something with all the winding country roads we have in WV Good gas mileage on the highway not so good in city   I have always loved Ford automobiles As a mom I got an Explorer for the diversity of our family Then when I hit my thirities and the get were older something was missing Our family wanted something that was fun and still practical to drive because gas was almost 450 per gallon I was going to get something before my midlife crisis We test drove a Mustang convertible and the family fit so we bought the car I love this car There is nothing I would change I have enough room for everthing When you down size from an Explorer then all that kids stuff you just stop bringing everything Boy do my kids smile when the top is down Moms go for it  Bought this car after convincing my wife we needed a convertible Since we have a child we needed something with a back seat Since I needed a sports car re not FWD the Mustang was the only real option After years of disliking Mustangs Fox platform versions and driving several Japanese cars Civics WRX etc I was pleasantly surprised how quickly this car reminded me whats important in a cara good sounding and performing engine great looks and backtobasics simplicity which means living with some shortcomings The rear live axle can feel a little unplanted on rough roads during spirited cornering The interior materials quality is also lowrent in look and feel  I bought my Mustang used I have always loved the Mustangs The only problem I had with mine is somebody changed the rear end oil and didnt seal it properly I had to replace the gears and lsd I replaced the 327s with 355s Amazing I have alot of mods intake exhaust gears suspension rims tires shifter audio hand held tuner The car responds well to mods Through on an Eibach Pro System Plus Kit with good tires and the handling becomes go kart like I recommend buying a Swarr Bar for the rear axles if you have a GT This will make the car more predictable on take off and in corners Only true problem I have had is the traction control kicking in too fast I just turn it off  I first drove a 05 Mustang V6 and after that I just had to own the new style Mustang My 07 GT convertible is a real blast to drive Cant decide whether to listen to the exhaust or the 500 watt stereo Like other comments the gas mileage acceleration and handling is superb in this car This is a true muscle car in my opinion The 300 HP v8 engine has plenty of power Mine is the torch red color with the hood scoop option I get comments all the time about the looks of it No rattles or problems since I got it new and its just over 2 years old now Will keep this car for a long time Paint quality is super on mine I have keep everything stock on it for now  Fun engine Comfortable interior Poor build quality several of misfittedmisaligned body panels convertible top issues windows are aligned differently when compared to each other etc Longterm reliability unknown but build quality leaves something to be desired  Price likely reflects use of cheap parts which could call into question longterm durability In summary its a fun modestly priced convertible with questionable quality control and unknown longterm reliability  It just does not give the same warm fuzzy that a Honda or Lexus does in terms of solid build quality right off the dealer lot Buy only after you have noted these cautions  We had a choice between a few beautiful stangs and bought this 04 40th anniversary edition Fully loaded with a Mach stereo system I upgraded the air filter plugs and oil which made a major difference I run at least 2528 mpg even going 80mph It handles very well drove through a wy winter storm and stuck to the road Gotta love my 39L  I imported my 2008 Black Mustang Convertible pony package from US to UAE United Arab Emirates being a sports car lover for years it was my dream come true but from the first day itself I was disappointed as far as comfy quality and power are concerned I thought Dodge Charger is more refined and comfortable mustang behaved like my 1997 Ford Explorer though I thought Explorer is better in comfortability But the moment I drop down the top it became totally different species all together I became the center attraction and it was fun to drive around in neighbor hood with loud music on Better than my 1999 Camaro Convertible All complaints are vanished   I bought this car as my first sports car and have been loving every minute of it The sound the ride the style everything is amazing With an intake tune and an exhaust system and the car turned into a completely different animal I have the California Special in Performance White and it stands out from even other Mustangs  I have enjoyed my Mustang convertible for 3 years It makes driving fun Top is down unless its raining ACHtr work fine to keep me comfortable in Texas heat Its my car its my funits my identity  After owning a 98v6 mustang and investing almost 2000 on paint rims body work and lights I new I needed a v8 I bought my gt because I got a good deal and because Ive always wanted a v8 mustang Acceleration is awesome you can hear this thing breathe Handles well also Takes corners like its on rails Interior is ok not as bad as some say well to my standards Leather is great convertable top is awesome Mpg is not that bad for me I get around 18 city and 26 on highway I have a heavy foot too Love the retro style Dont regret purchasing this beast Wish I had more power but I can fix that with aftermarket stuff  Girlfriend and I recently purchased the GT with less then 70000 miles  Engine runs as good as anyone I have ever driven  The power is NICE  Dont have to worry about passing traffic or getting on the freeway  Its nice knowing those 300 pounds of torque are ready on tap anytime you need them  The car looks great with the top down and sure is a head turner where ever we go  For a 2002 model this car can almost kick the living crap out of any other car on the road when it comes to racing  260 horse power and 302 pounds of torque well you get the picture  060 in 54 secs and a quater mile time of 1400 at 101 miles an hour well that sure beats most imports by a mile even in 2009  An all around great quality car  I highly recommend it  The V8 has plenty of power I have added exhaust and Intake which are a must for this model  The exhaust adds that mean rumble while the intake adds hp and saves major gas  The only down side is the interior is cheap but doesnt look too bad  It is also rough in the winter but what car isnt  I test drove a mustang convertible 16 years ago but put off the purchase because of the insurance cost  16 years later I finally purchased a 2010 gt prem convone of the benefits of getting oldlower insurance costs and could not be happier  This car is true American muscle car its powerful fun to drive and a great value  The cons axle handling are all shortcomings I can live with  So if you are in the market for a muscle car I would highly recommend this car  I considered buying a  late 60s early 70s muscle car but decided that the Mustang would give me the same thrillfeel without the hassle of dealing with an ongoing restoration project  I bought a 2002 GT new and it was a fun car but the insurance was too much and I had to sell it I just bought this 2001 GT convertible and it brings back all the great memories of that 02 but now the insurance is 13 the price I love these cars because they are the cheapest fun you can use to commute to work I get 27 mpg 130 miles a day and my 3 year old loves it Its loud flowmaster fun fast and engaging for a person that loves cars Why anybody would commute in a boring daily driver I cant understand when you can get these things so cheap used and they get decent mileageI was buying a new Challenger this year but think I made the right choice   What a great car If ford had been making these cars 10 years ago they wouldnt be in the trouble there in Every one needs a convertible this is a great one wish it had a little more horse power but if it did I wish it had even more  My car has the shaker stereo leather etc  I was surprised that the Radial TAs it came with stunk  got rid of those tires and replaced them with some hot Falkens  now it handles GREAT  It is really just a two seater tho  dont really know why Ford had to design the rear seat with the back practically straight up but it makes sitting back there a painful experience if more than a couple blocks  The front seats are great  and LOTS of leg room  You can see the seams in some of the plastics which detracts from an otherwise well executed interior design  I bought the V6 thinking it would get better mileage  I shoulda got the 8 I think it mighta got better mileage  I have always wanted a convertable for my long commutes home This is real therapy I love my car it has been very reliable No problems AT ALL from 60110000 miles Ive had it Soon it will need some maintanence but probably expected Gas mileage could be better but its an older car with a TON of power under the hood Pretty comfortable but the back seat is impractical for adult use I think only small kids actually fit Good sized trunk for the size of the car and it always feels safe  I like the traction control feature and the handling is superb Its an easy ride although mine is a little loud which makes it difficult to hear sometimes Its been a great ride and lots of fun  I bought my convertible GT in Febuary and fell in love She had less than 25000 miles on her when i bought it Very reliable and very fun to drive She really has some pick up and go Not only is the convertible fun to drive its fun to play with as well I have flowmaster mufflers a cold air intake and various other modifications The cool thing about mustangs is that its not just a car it can be a hobby  just purchased my 2009 V6 convertible mustang it had 9500 miles when purchased I drove it to Pensacola Fl the next week and it drove great with good gas mileage so far I have really enjoyed this car the style and ride is really great No problems at all  I just got this 2010 vehicle on Monday July 6 2009  I have always wanted a yellow convertible since I was 5 years old  Im now 71 and I must say my Sunset Gold Mustang is all I hoped it would be  Its like driving a big computer so much to learn about the car  However it is very comfortable and easy to drive  It has a lot of pickup for a V6 and I love the Sirrus Radio  I really dont know what else to say escept its the fun car to drive especially with the top down whether you are 20 or a Senior Citizen  I am the original owner of my 01 convertible and I am extremely impressed with the build quality  Other than scheduled fluid changes I have not had a single issue  The car starts everytime it is fun to drive and for what it is an entry level sports car I am a very satisfied customer  Having owned a 95 coupe this car is superior in every way  I have modified the car with dual exhaust w GT bumper hood  side scoops a fibreglass front bumper tires  rims welded subframe connectors strut tower brace pedal kit and new air intake  Well my wife traded in her mountaineer for a mustang  Having her midlife crisis  She got the V6 premium with automatic and convertible  She also had the GT stripe installed over the hood and trunk  The color of the car is Kona blue  Very sharp looking and we get looks where ever we go  Car is well put together and solid  Ford really addressed past weakeness in the car  Car gets good mileage on the highway  We went out to Pa on business with straight open highway driving and the car got 26 MPG doing 70  Not bad for less than a 1000 miles on the car  If someone is looking for a two door sports coupe they should look at this first before going to the imports  My daughter and soninlaw bought this car for me brandnew as a gift in 2000  I love this car and have lots of fun driving it  It has never had anything go wrong with it in the 9 years that I have owned it  It is a beautiful black convertible very sleek and sporty  This is my second Mustang owned the first model in 1965 and I highly recommend them  We have several mustangs but this is the boss of them all Love the design and the handling of the car  Love the microsoft synch  Car is fun to drive and great to look at  Bought it new and have 63k miles  Never a problem  Added some goodies headers catback CAI 373 rearend and hurst short throw  360hp  Love this car  I still get comments from people I have never had a brake job and Im at 63k miles and still have 20 wear left  Solid solid solid is what this car is  I wont ever get rid of it  Best thing Ford ever did  Just bought the car new a few weeks ago Have been enjoying it ever since Lots of compliments on the car especially the color Kona Blue metallic Plenty of power decent comfort and handles surprisingly well for its size Nice stereo Sync system works well but takes a while to figure out  Always wanted a muscle car but got married young while my friends were driving Mustangs Road Runners and Corvettes  Now they are driving mini vans while I am cruising in my GT convertible  Started talking to my wife about getting a Mustang since the 05 hit the dealers not really thinking that she would go along with it until one day she said if we get one can it be a convertible it was then that I knew she wanted it as much as I did  I hesitated about the convertible since I never had one and I remember the old  rag tops leaking with lots of wind noise  I test drove one and found it to be pleasanty quiet with the interior of the roof very plush hardly looking like a convertible  Ive had my car for three weeks V6 convertible Black on Black I have never gotten so many looks and compliments about a car before The styling is great the ride is fun this is my first Mustang Looked at other convertibles but this one I had to have     This car means only pleasure I am a Mustang lover this is the first one that I bought and I can tell you that the car is the best of the best Its retro style and power engine only can give you good moments Mine is convertible then drive with the top down is really a dream    I just bought my self a midlife crisis treat a 2002 Mustang GT convertible with a five speed manual tranny and  all the bells and whistles available in 2002  I was sitting in the Corvette I was going to buy when it caught my eye  There isnt a mark on it inside or out and is if I may use the term a freakin rocket  The sound system is incredible Yes old guys still rockbest thing I ever did for myselfif you dont have one get one     Only had the car 3 months and will store it for the winter  Inside and out this car reminds me of my all time favorite 67 Mustang  Car has Flowmaster exhaust sounds great awesome V8 rumble  Leather seats are very comfortable Mach 1000 stereo is outstanding  Seriously 100 mph top down tunes sound perfect  Original owner said only issue he had was door covers vibrating with tunes loud  Dealer packed the doors with insulation no more problem  Quality of interior materials is very good better than most cars  Fit and finish is excellent  Mileage is fairly good if you behave but thats tough to do   too much fun  Get one before theyre gone  An overall great car to drive and very very fun  Tons of power and very responsive steering I also test drove a convertible BMW 330i which also was responsive and great to drive but the Mustang won out due to the lesser cost and greater power  I have never owned a convertible but now I wont go back to a regular coupe  I cant say enough good things about this car  My whole life I have dreamed of owning a convertible but never thought that day would come Finally at Thirty years old that day came TRUE I researched all the different models of convertibles and none of the others compared to the Ford Mustang The Mustang rated the highest in safety which was one of my main concerns Another was the comfort and room for passengers and again the Mustang had it all    I commuted 160 miles a day in this and have 202000 on it  Engine still running great Top is now ready to be replaced last much longer than I thought  Im 63 yrs young and Ive had a lot of different cars in my life My last car got totaled so I went looking for a muscle car Im tired of 4s and 6s I loked around for about 2 months I found my perfect car a 1998 mustang gt convertible Ive had it for about 9 months and had a blast in it It had 120000 miles on it and I havent had a bit of trouble with it All my old friends ask me about gas mileage I tell them I could care less I give them a ride in it with the top down and they want to buy one Of course they have to glue their tupees on a little better I have trouble judging distances on parking so this is a great fit for me I will have no other car than a mustang  Love my convertible  Fun to drive and enjoy the power  If you have more than one child makes for a challenge if they want to take friends somewhere  Not much trunk space  Looks good and sounds even better  Didnt buy the car for fuel efficiency so gas mileage is not an issue for me  Multiple CD changer and sound system add to its appeal  Convertible top easy to operate  My Mustang was special ordered just for me  The car is everything I knew it would be and more  This is the second convertible mustang I have owned  The first was in 1984 Now 26 years later I have another one  Love the my color ambient lighting love the sync and navigation love the backup camera  Color choice was white wa black top and one of the striping packages also in black Im averaging 19 city and 24 highway I was thinking the mpgs would be a little better being that it is only a V6 engine but its still new and not broke in yet  I am so happy with my car  I did a lot of research before I made my decision and I couldnt have picked a better car LOVELOVELOVE IT  This is my 3rd Stang having previously owned an 86GT Hatch and an 86LX Cnvt Bought the 99 with 11000 miles in 2001 Currently has 145000 This is a great car Have had almost no mechanical problems Great style and performance Great exhaust sounds Mach 460 radioCD is great too Convertible top works well Tends to eat brakes Headlight covers do fog over Dont hit a bump in the middle of a turn or youll find yourself in the next lane  I bought this car used with 17000 miles and it was in perfect condition The acceleration is decent but could always use more power Handling has been excellent even in the 3 blizzards weve had this year You do get bounced around quite a bit on bumpy roads but then again its not exactly a luxury car My Color backlighting is a cool feature to play around with Insurance surprisingly wasnt that bad considering I live in NJ All in all this car has been amazing to own and a blast to drive considering its a 110 HP improvement over my previous car   If this were a car it would be a blond airhead that seduces you in the beginning but doesnt hold your interest and isnt reliable over the long run After three years the only part of the car I like is the V8 engine The suspension is crude and not up to the power of the engine The manual trans is hard to shift and the clutch is heavy This car requires a lot of attention to drive smoothly especially in anything but warm dry weather and Ive been to performance driving school The stereo is missing the midrange its all highs  lows and the menu system is dangerous to use while driving The ergonomics are horrible with cup holders in the way of the shifter and inadequate storage  I will never get another Ford My gear shifter is broken the top leaks the light knob is super glued on transmission is going out the leather is tearing passenger doesnt close right I can keep going but Ill stop now oh wait did I mention it gets CRAPPY gas mileage  This is my first Mustang and have enjoyed it so far Great looking Kona Blue metallic paint awesome V8 sound and handles well for its size and weight Gets lots of looks and compliments Everybody likes this car Except remorseful Camaro owners  I got mine used at 17000 miles and have put another 16000 miles on it  Now its 3 years old and runs great  Nice loud exhaust and with the top down Im amazed how many people pull up next to me and want to talk about my car  For a V6 its got lots of pep although if you romp on the gas it takes half a second to take off  I just purchased a used 2007 GTCS convertible for some summer fun  This car is a blast to drive on a sunny day with the top down  Great acceleration and exhaust note  It also handles better than I expected  The lower profile and 18 inch wheels on the California Special probably helps here  I bought this car strictly for weekend and pleasure driving and so far Im very pleased  Since the initial unveiling of the new body style for 2005 I have patiently yearned for a 2007 Mustang My wait finally came to a glorious end last Friday when I tradedin my 1997 V6 black coupe and purchased a 2007 Grabber Orange GT convertible To quote the 1975 Queen song title Im in love with my car The Mustang GT is all I expected and more First since this car is my fifth Mustang I have grown accustom to the tractionless rear end Yet the GT feels solid and attached to the road The car has a terrific low end sound yet quiet enough to hear the stereo passengers and yes the familiar convertible rattle But Ill take a little rattle over a minivan any day of the week  Oh yea  This car is a riot I ran with the stock motor for about 6 months then had a custom tuned blown four valve motor installed It cranks 630 RWHP Looks like a stock GT Needless to say I have a lot of fun leaving a lot of people in the dustBy the time they hear that supercharger whine they know they going to be looking at my tailights How can you not love one of these cars Rough and crude pure American muscle     Bought the car with 9000 km and 11 months old The car has 90000 km as of May 2010 The car has been bullet proof in terms of reliability I have just replaced the tires and the original battery The only issues have been Engine check light on briefly at 87K and selfcleared must have been a loose gas filler cap and the rear tail light bulbs blow every 15K or so 4 bulbbig deal Other than that just oil and filter changes Car has been very reliable and solid Body creaksgroans at 90K are still minimal but you can now tell the car is nearly 4 years old lots of life left in it I will replace shocks  struts this year and this should solve the problem  Overall a lot of fun and a great value among high performance cars Fit and finish to a surprising high standardthis is my first American car in many years and I had almost given up Powertrain is awesome and electronics suite is better than my Audi  Ergonomics and cabin convenience are sorely lacking  Glove box wont even hold manuals No place to put mailbox keys etc Cupholder makes shifting clumsy and needs better design Yes we do need a water bottle in the car in an AZ summer  My black Mustang rides like a buckboard the leather seats are flat the interior door panels and console are cheap Its a Mustang for crying out loud Its an icon a legend The Mach 6 CD amfm stereo is simply amazing Your choices for a convertible are rather limited A Chysler Sebring a Pontiac that they quit making a BMW with a price tag over two times any similar Mustang The Mustang is the only logical choice Smooth and easy top operation The trunk holds what it needs too Golf clubs baseball bags tennis rackets groceries 2 medium suitcases No its not big its a sports car not a luxo boat The people that complain about this car are ill please see a doctor   I bought the premier V6 convertible with the pony package because I did not believe I required a Hi performance sports car  After thorough research I decided on the V6 and consider a roadster  In that category it is a great vehicle that in my opinion out paces its competition in most areas  It is fun to drive and invokes pleasant responses from other people   Rides like a buckboard reasonable handling mileage and the Mach stereo is a beast If you dont like a Mustang convertible lets look at your choices An older Cavalier a Sebring or LeBaron that will likely have numerous issues a costly BMW or a Porsche that is likely beyond costly for similar year and miles Its the only choice out there under 12000 with low miles   For the past 10 years Ive been driving a BMW 330 convertible Audi A4 V6 and Porsche 964 but my 10 GT Mustang is most fun of all Had to install the FR3 handling pack to tighten it up but awesomely enjoyable now 315 hp is enough to move it around in any gear 5spd manual even with a 331 rear gear 18 mpg around town Tight build quality Grabber blue w1970 Mach 1 hood stripes Topped it off with Saleen 20 wheels   This is the second Mustang I have owned but the first one was about 20 years ago The car is as good as every review had written land more I actually got stopped by the police in rural Wisconsin to check on the missing license permit which was in the front window as the car is a CV What they really wanted to do is ask questions about the vehicle which they did  Bought this for a steal as Ford was trying to get rid of all the 2007s for the 2008s MSRP 36k and bought it for 27k  I have been VERY happy with it from day one  Not a single issue with the vehicle itself  The Tires did wear out VERY quickly at about 20k miles but I replaced them with some high quality aquatreads from Discount Tire  Awesome Shaker 1000 sound system SO much fun to drive just wish the kids  wife would let me keep the top down more   Of note I average 23 MPG on the computer in the car  I live in a rural area so most of my driving is 70 75 mph on back roads and in town I keep it in 5th gear when going 3540 mph love my stick shift  Have only put about 1000 miles on my new Mustang convertible but its already easily the best Mustang I have owned The power from this new V6 is outstanding and the handling and braking are top notch I have the 6 spd Auto and it handles the engine very well Steering is direct and well weighted controls all feel of the highest quality This is the first Mustang Ive driven that feels in many ways like my Hondas In fact with the real aluminum trim and fabulous Sync system this Mustang is more luxurious and sophisticated than most other cars in its price class And top down well nothing is better Top is thick and seals very well    This is the best car Ive owned  No one single mechanical problem after 5 plus years of ownership I had the opportunity to run this monster on the German autobahn at speeds in excess of 140 mph with the top down What an experience  Buy one you will not be disappointed  Great job on this one Ford  This 2011 V8 GT Mustang is incredible Its extremely fast and it rides and handles very good Mine has the 6spd auto trans premium trimmed Grabber Blue with the 401A interior trim pkge with the blue seat stripes and stitching I ordered the Shaker 1000 stereo which is totally awesome Got the exterior conv pkge 6 with dual side vents hood scoop deck lid trim panel and pedestal spoiler 19 inch painted nickel alum wheels very nice and probably rare Drop the top and enjoy it This is my ninth Mustang since 1968 Just started enjoying my car   I love my GTCS The performance is very exciting and the 46 does a nice job to really get this car moving I have an auto and its no slug it will get up and move when you want it to  The drop top is a very nice feature  Easy to operate and fairly quick to raiselower Due to the live rear axle you can experience some drivability issues when pushing the car around a turn with bumps in the road not enough for me to really consider it not drivable when pushed  I have the shaker 500 and its loud enough to hear with the top down while driving 80 For MPG you can get good numbers if you are being very good  Top down 1824 and up 2025  You can have a new car with just a few mods enjoy  Automobile magazine writers have had good reviews on this car and that encouraged me to check out the V6 305 HP engine 37 liter  My last V6 Mustang 1974 Mach 1 had a 28 liter Cologne engine  Absolutely no comparison possible The old car could get 25 MPG This car can get up and boogie and still give me 288 MPG on the freeway at 77 MPH  It has good handling characteristics good looks and good build quality My wife really liked the AC and the ride Our one gripe is a small trunk  Dont plan on bringing a lot of luggage if you take a 1000 mile trip unless you want to use the back seat for the extra suitcase We are very happy with the car  I purchased her brand new Worth every penny 10 years later she is still fun to drive Hugs roads and has great pick up I would buy again Issues were the exhaust manifold design is bad I think the AC drips onto it and as a result had to have it welded back together twice because it sounded like a hole in the muffler Also the clutch went out on her 2 years ago and that had to be replaced Other than those 2 things I have not had one single mechanical issue She is picky about her tires Anything but Yokahomas seem to run rough Extremely reliable Cosmetics after 10 years my top leaks in behind the back seat due to being left in the sun and not in a garage Middle tail light faded  I was concerned and apprehensive when I went from a Mercedes C230 Sport to the Mustang GT Convertible On day two I knew I made the right decision  This car rocks  The car generates amazing torque and speed  The exhaust and engine are perfectly matched it makes a deep throaty growl when I get on the accelerator  The handling is superb The first time I dropped the transmission into second gear going around a corner and goosed it Im sure I looked like the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland I had such a grin   This car is without a doubt more powerful responsive and refined than the 50 GT I bought new in 1990  I am so happy with this car I want to sleep in it Thank you Ford   I bought the car used with 65k miles  It was in great shape with exception of the leather driver seat and a small leak from the power steering hose  The leak never materialized to anything and the seat continued to deteriorate  Thats the worst of it  Otherwise it was  reliable fast and very fun  The gas mileage was better than my mini van  I did sell it but wish I didnt  It was a great car  My wife  I rented a 2010 Mustang convertible to drive from Kentucky to the NASCAR race at Watkins Glen in early August  That rental proved a stronger sales tool than any dealership could ever provide When reading the features of the 2011 model we decided they far outweighed any price savings obtainable from a 2010 year end deal  We love the styling peppy V6 305 hp with smooth sounding dual stainless steel exhausts  The sync system takes a little adopting to  My short drives tofrom work a a real joy whenever the top is down  Evening drives with the top down are exhilarating   This is my sixth Mustang since 1980 and my third convertible 1984 50LX V8 and 1987 GT V8 I had it out for a two hour top down drive today When you drive this new Mustang GT you feel as if youre an active part of the car It fits you so well and is that flawless in everything it does And its ride handling and V8 engine performance are all totally off the scale Fords new EPAS steering is incredible best ever They just seem to have gotten everything right on this car My Mustang was the first Mustang GT convertible sold by my dealer It was specially ordered by me and took exactly eight weeks as promised I took delivery on July 9th  The new styling is perfect This car triple black gets stares and comments almost every time I drive it Its comfortable extremely hot looking fast nimble and the sound from the pipes is music Build quality is fine price is reasonable and I fit my whole family in it What else can you ask for I could only rate fun to drive a max of 10 but I would have given it a 15 There are many accessories out there to personalize it and further improve performance so itll never get old The premium fuel is worth the extra cost Glad I didnt wait for the 2011 The 46 is plenty powerful and a tried and true performer while the 50 needs a few years of reliability history under its belt   This the best car i have ever owned It is black on black and I love to drive it I have never gotten so many complements on a car before when I put the top down people just stop and stare I test drove a lot of convertibles before my wife suggested the Mustang it was the last one I test drove got it that same day Did I say I love driving it I have become a Mustang Man      only had this about 2 weeks this is the first ford mustang i have owned so far everything is great love letting the top down and cruising around town  ur silver on black Pony was a retirement gift to ourselves We have owned 3 Vettes and a 65 Impala convert and the Pony has been the most fun economical and reliable We have put 93000 km 60k mi across most of Canada and winters in Arizona the past 3 years Winnipeg winter mileage is awful otherwise no fuel complaints Initially we had a couple of minor warranty claims otherwise wasted  buying extended service plan as problem free I follow the service book to the T and the car looks after us Large trunk hauls our water jugs and groceries to our cottage fine The heated leather seats are comfy and the car gets a lot of compliments   Good looks and fun to drive but the roof leaks above driver and passenger windows  After 2 dealer visits no help so far  Leaks in drivethrough car wash  Owners manual and Ford hot line maintain power washing could cause this problem but car was not exposed to power washer Havent driven in more than light rain so severity of problem remains to be seen  This pony pak V6 is one awesome Mustang  Every where I go People stop and stare or shout WOW handles and rides great and great power this is the best ride I ever bought and I have bought lots of them over the years the interior is pure quality and the paint candy red is flawless  I have a 67 Mustang also  The 11 is so retro  not like a Camaro  Buy one you wont be disappointed    This is the base v6 convertible Only option is the 6 speed auto All the positives in the reviews are spoton This car is sensational The negatives Ive read dont even apply at least to me My 61 son has sat in the back  with the drivers seat in normal position I am 6 He said he wouldnt want to sit there all day but even a couple hours would be fine That was a surprise  I thought the back seat was just for the insurance companies I have only 1000 miles on the car had it for 2 wks  and got 30 mpg on a 90 minute trip the other day And that included an  ahem  acceleration test on the highway A blast to drive and thats with the top up Top down  fantastic  I bought this car several months back with about 87k on it and Im already pushing 99k Other than an issue with the electrical system due to chewed up battery terminals a 6 fix it has been one hell of a ride I checked out camaros and a charger or two while I was searching but every mustang I sat in just felt more comfortable and even better I could actually see out of it After a few bolton modifications it can turn some heads Im hardpressed to say that Ill probably have at least a mustang in my garage at all times from now on You only get one chance at a first car and this nasty pony did the job  Wow That is all that is needed to be said This car is for anyone aged 16116 who wants to own the most fundollar vehicle on the market With sleek 1969 Mach 1 tribute styling the 2012 Mustang GT gives everyone the opportunity to own a piece of Muscle Car History and be the baddest car on the road The new Mustang is extremely light compared to the Camaro and the Challenger and with the 6 Speed Manual and 373 rear end this car is like a rocket both in the straight line and in corners It is extremely good looking extremely comfortable to drive and is unbelievable fast for the price Highly recommended to Everyone  I recently bought the GT convertible after looking at the Camaro and Challenger Immediately loved it but decided to add some stealth performance so had the Ford Racing supercharger instaaled along with Magnaflow exhaust to give a little more rumble Now 600 horsepower and fast not the word for it Now a Corvette killer The Camaro and Challenger dont even come close  I purchased a 1998 GT as a project car to keep and tinker with Needless to say this will be a good challenge for me There a few things to repair and customize Above all the engine is rumbling like a champ LOVE the engine and exhaust sound Black and tan interior match very well and replacement parts are fair in price I plan on doing some upgrades to the engines Even as a used car a GT 46L has a lot of power and will give incredible speeds Parents beware you should not buy your teenager such a powerful car Buy they aa base mustang V6V4  This car is a great value and Ford did a wonderful job merging classic design into a modern worldI get around 20mpg 18 if I rod around in the city and up to 26 on the hwyI think that the dark blue version is the best color and while my car has a grey interior and black top I think that the best color combo is the dk blue with tan interiortopNevertheless I get comments on my car all the time  this car is great for meeting peopleLOLI upgraded the lousy tires that Ford ships with the car  I went from being able to take a 45 mph corner at 55 to 80If you test one and question its performance I would suggest checking on the tires      First  let my inform you readers Im very car knowlegeable I am quite skilled in the field of automotive engines and electronics I deal with driveability issues every day Having said that this is my first Ford in 17 years Its my middleagecrisis toy Im a guy who has owned scores of GM vehicles  some good and some lousy I went with Ford this time because this is a company that doesnt appear to do alot of the dumb engineering things I have witnessed lately on either GM or Mopar Having said all that lets talk about the car itselfI purchased this winter with only 4300 miles on it I now have over 16000 miles on it after a few long distance trips the last couple months   Been an import guy for 20 years but decided to upgrade to the new Mustang Its roomier without feeling like a boat better on gas milage than some imports and built rock solid Great commuter  Recently purchased a used 2011 Mustang Convertible w 22kLike the look but extremely unhappy with the quality of some interior parts as well as the Ford 336 Bumper to Bumper warrantyFirst thing wrong is my 6way power drivers seat makes a terrible noise and moves very slow to not at all at times and Ford says that because it still works they will not replace it so play with it until it goes outHas an engine or tranny hesitation then the radio buttons on the steering wheel have the paint chipping off and the tan convertible top shows the black grease everytime you put it downI am no kid and am not hard on my baby but very disappointed in the car and Ford  I had a chance to buy one of the last new original 1973 Mustang convertibles back in 1974 and I made the mistake of letting my Dad talk me out of itIt wasnt until 2007 that I decided it was time for a convertibleIve owned 7 Fords since 1986 and have never had a single problem where the car had to go back to the dealer so I was confident on qualityI special ordered a redfire metallic premium V6 Pony convertible with auto transmission satellite radio and everything I could getAnd I couldnt be happierIts very tight quiet and a blast to driveIve added sequential turn signals and its a real headturner   This is my first car i got it in July 2011 for 14k a pretty good deal for my dream car The v6 is slightly underpowered compared to the Challenger and Camaro v6 but it is also much lighter actually beating both the challenger and camaro its a chick magnet and its fun to see their face when you put the top down  Overall its a blast to drive and ill remember my first car for the rest of my life I payed for it myself my father was willing to give me the extra 3k for a malibu since i live in Traverse City MI where winters are bad I got the Mustang anyways and have been extremely happy with our decision i definitely recommend this car the engine sounds amazing too fun fun car  This is my first Mustang first convertible and first V6 I really wanted a convertible and it really is great You actually feel good sitting in and driving the car and it is spunky enough for a sports carReally enjoyable the interior is really pretty all leatherMy 8 year old girl iis overjoyed and myself being 50 I really have a great time driving it with or without the top down Used to have a 5 liter Capri back in the 80s and although that had a lot more power this newer Mustang is much more comfortable to drive Gas mileage for this V6 is pretty good Beate Frederick MD  I bought this car on 12142011 Ive only driven it for over month it is my daily driver It has only 19000 miles on it and it is absoutely stunning I love everything about this car The way the engine rumbles the noise of the blinkers the sound of the door when you shut it the stero is kickin the ease at which the top goes up and down I have learned that you actually have to be careful in slower traffic because when you step on the gasyou get an instant response And yes I have raced it I have smoked everyone that I have come up against  in town and highway  with barely any effort This car was made to go fast And is excellent therapy if you have a stressful day at work  OkFirst Im a Corvette fanSo when my partner bought a 2011 Mustang Gt Convertible Auto I thought I would not like it but that I would just have to be supportiveBut to my surpriseI love this carI have a 2005 Vette Convertible and I would much rather take the Mustang on a trip than the VetteI knowI cant believe it but its the truthThis car is comfortable fast will take a curve like nobodys bussiness and looks pretty good doing it tooIf your thinking about one Get itYou wont be sorry maybe surprised like me  I have always wanted a convertible and could never find one I really likedI recently started test driving the Pontiac G6 and Chrysler Sebringthey could not even compare to how the mustang convertible droveI love my car black body black top and black interiorIt is so sleek looking and when I drive by with the top down people just stop and stareSuper fun car to drive and I fit my friends in there perfectlyDefinitely recommend  Its motor 46 is smaller than dads old 289 cu in with the 2 bbl carburetorAnd its an electric Grabber Blue color wblack cloth top  which always looks better when not sitting on a car lotI keep it garaged and only drive it on nice daysLoads of looks and compliments on the streetIts actually an automatic not offered in Model review selection info by Edmunds and it works perfectly for a vehicle made in summer of 2009Wife gave it to me as a 25th anniversary presentIt surprising how nice this vehicle is and the sound it makes is just rightNo tickets anddrive it with traction control activatedAn ounce of Image is worth a pound of performance  Ive had my Mustang for a week and I love itIt has fantastic giddyup pretty good mileage and it looks better than anything else on the roadThe engine is swift and responsive the SelectShift transmission is smooth and Im enjoying the Electronics package with Sync Navigation and entertainment options  Ive owned this car for a couple of weeks now and 700 miesSo this is a first impression with 700 miles on the odometerThe 50 convertible puts a smile on my face every time we go for a rideI love the retro styling old enough to have seen it the first time and the exahuast note with the top downJust took the first leg of a 140 mile trip and it performed flawlesslyIt is a base model GT convertible with M6 and 301A tech package which includes SYNCFor the trip with a little preplanning we managed to get everthing in the trunk for a 4 day trip wife and myself including a small coolerWould I buy it againYes  I got my 2013 GT Premium Convertible and have been surprised at how much I really like itI have never really been a fan of the newer 1980 forward Mustang designs until I saw this oneThe new front and rear design is greatThe car turns and handles well even with the solid rear axle but not as well as the Mazda MX5 which I upgraded fromThe 50 V8 is powerful and responsive with the 6 speed manual and when you stomp on the pedal it always brings a smileThe upgraded Brembo brakes help a bunch and although you can feel that the car is heavy it still is a load of fun to drivePlus the car turns a lot of heads   I recently bought a 2010 Mustang Convertible base V6 automaticWhat an awesome ride It has more than enough power to get me into trouble and is an absolute beautyThe lines are amazingId recommend it to anyone  ive had the car for almost 2 years and have had 3 engines in it Driver window fail fuel pump failed CD player failed and the transmission has small leak i love the car dont really plan on ever selling but its not recommended for a daily driver its not very reliable but its 10 years oldBut for a fun top down weekend warrior its great and its idea for customizationI know more than 10 people with the same style mustang GT and they have problems too but still love them if you buy one I recommend having 23k set aside for future repairs MPG isnt great either I average 15MPG combinedBut it works for me becauseI only drive the car maybe once a month  Alread forgot my bmw 1 series convertible Enter the mustang gt convertible premiumThis car is jam packed with valueThe car has great ergonomics the sync system works flawlessly the engine is a beast of beasts and shocked me with its pure power and torqueI expected the interior of car to be cheaply madeBut to my surprise the car is beautifully appointed and laid out smartlyNot cheaply done at allThe shaker stereo rocksCrisp highs and nice lows with no distortionBluetooth is amazing works great with the top down and wind blowing at 60 mphCar handles great and has a great bite on the road No doubt you get more car then a bmw and save over 10kIts a no brainer  I have a convertible and like it but I feel the price for the V6 Premium was about 5K too much and I bought it usedI have only had it three weeks and was a victim of a nasty hit and run while I was in a store so it sits in the shopIt will be interesting how it will hold up after being repairedMy girlfrield loves taking it on tight curves so I think this will be more her favorite car than mineI miss my 2011 Fusion SELMuch better bang for the buck  If youd be upset with a creaky front end having to return to the dealer a few times in the first 1015K miles for warranty work front end bushings and a potential wheel bearing failure then this is not the car for youWith all of that said the style and performance far outweighs any squeaks creaks rattles or noises plus the fact that its under warranty until 36KI will most likely be trading this in for a 50th Anniversary edition of the same model not only because I am sure Ill want one but also because if Im having bushing trouble and a fairly loud wheel bearing noise at 15K milesI cant imagine that the longterm reliability is good   Ive been driving my Mustang for about six months now and I have yet to be disappointed The V6 engine really has a suprising amount of punch and I simply love the way the Sync system works The mileage has been as promised and no warranty issues that need to be fixed I think a review has a better impact if it has some criticism but I really dont have anything to criticizeI especially like the entire lighting packagebright exterior customizable interior If you are thinking about buying a Mustangdrive it at nightits an entirely different experience  Ive always wondered how people come to hate a car company Ford usually being top of the list of most hated Now I know First theres a problem with the pedal assembly that prevented the driver from being able to depress the clutch properly and shift the transmission Car is out of warranty by 1000 miles and a few months its going to cost xxx More recently the interior is literally falling apart the pleather insert on the door panels is peeling off Car has 38k miles nothing we can do outside of the warranty itll cost xxx Even called Fords customer service line same response Well be selling this as we dont want to be on the hook for even bigger costlier problems later  I bought the 2011 v6 Mustang coupe due to the many refinements and was very happy with it but I had bought the base model and was wanting a convertibleThere was enough refinements in looks and performance as well as features that got me to trade in my 2011 for a 2013 This is the first time I have ever owned a convertible so it is a new experience for me I think everyone should own a convertible at least once in their lifeI got the premium auto with pony package all leather and sync The drive is much better than the 2011 and the looks are more masculine on the 2013 than the 2011 Even with the V6 there is enough power to do what you want  I just recently bought a 2000 White Mustang Convertible I have the automatic version and have not regretted it since I bought it The gas mileage isnt greatI only get about 300km on each tank but its so worth it This car is fun to drive especially when you put the top down and hear that engine Its powerful and turns heads Mine has the leather and suede interior which is a nice feature as all leather can get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter Only complaint would be the brakes squeal a bitits easily fixed with brake cleaner but Ive heard is a common issue with this year and model Either way Id fully recommend this car So fun to drive and good looking   V8 Engine smooth and fast Car looks great but when I hand wash or it rains water gets in door sills trunk wells hood leaks out of plastic around fog lights and rear lights front and rear bumper crevices After 50 years youd think Ford would have learned how to build this car tighter At a Sticker Price with tax of over 50000 they need  Ive had experience driving all sorts of vehicles and I can say without a doubt that my 2002 Ford Mustang GT is among the best of the best in almost all categories For starters its a Mustang an American icon Now take that image add 260 stock horsepower and youve got a beast of a carNot only is it powerful it gets surprisingly great mileage mine is getting roughly 26 mpg highway The thing is also built like a tank I havent had any mechanical issues other than routine maintenance The only issues are low seating capacity and cargo room but hey you dont get a Mustang in place of an SUV do you  Wow  Driving a 2014 V6 Convertible around Central Florida is FUN  There are compromises  V6 for regular gas automatic tranny more practical when I4 is a parking lot BUT  this car hugs the road loves curves accelerates  brakes smoothly I enjoy the handling as much as my wife appreciates the smooth ride Still learning to use the SYNC but Im getting there  Great carhad mine for 6 years bought it when it had a little over 100k needless to say i added another 150 k on it Engine is extremely reliable as long as you maintain regular oil changes Only bad side of this car is weather be very careful in the rain and snow do not drive over 30 miles an hour in the rain and park it when it snows   After previously having a total of 9 Camaros and Firebirds I finally defected from GM to Ford and bought this Mustang and I gotta tell you its pretty awesome And after coming straight from a problemplagued technologicaloverkillonwheels BMW 335i this car is quite a breath of fresh air by comparison Sure its a bit cruder in some spots but at the end of the day theres nothing like an allAmerican convertible icon with a honking V8 engine and retro style and attitude that this car has in spades  i bought my first 97 and on the way home with it a fool ran a stop sign at about 50mph and t boned me i woke up to smoke from the aiar bags but i was alive i hurt my neck a bit from the air bag impact but i was fine i went ahead and ordered me another one with 17 miles on it i got the sports appearance package the mach 460 sound system SWEET and an alarm system with a motion sensor the company statement was if my baby was stolen and i still had the two fobs they would give me 5k i still have it and at 113k it still runs great ive replace the suspension system but can still take those turns at 60mph easy  I had a new car and had so many problems Hard to work and picture it being a throw away car like some I decided to go backwards to a 2002 V6 that reminds me more of the days aperson could work on a carHAHAHAThere are some people who have these cars and they are over 200000 milesWhen you buy something at this age remember it may need a couple things Dont gripe about it Do your homework Some people beat the Hell out of them I happen to get mine from an older man in his 60s who took care of it  Ive had my 2012 base V6 convertible auto a few monthsIt was a rental and has just under 50000 milesMy first MustangIt is certainly behind in design compared with European sports carsespecially the base modelbut the appeal of the Mustang is in some ways its simple raw charismanot its bling The new V6 has awesome acceleration and can match the old V8 in terms of performanceThe stock auto setup is a compromise thoughFor general driving the Mustang is sweetWhen you want to unleash the beastthere is throttle lag and imprecise gear shifts until you get above 3500 rpmthen she pulls like a train   I drove the Challenger Camaro and MustangThe Dodge was a slug and the Camaro drove well but felt excessively claustrophobic and its lines never sang to me as did the stangI was hooked After 25000 miles in my Sterling Gray 50 GT with 6 speed manual I still REALLY enjoy driving itEvery time I get in it after a couple of days away its like an eager puppy that wants to go out and romp  with 412 HPGreat bang for the buck  There she was  50 vert with a 6 speed loaded white with a black roof and interiorThe car is very spritely almost go kart like especially after trading in a Hemi Challenger She rides on rails stops on a dime and is jack rabbit quick The interior fit me better than the SS and sight lines are better in the GT The interior its comfortable  ergonomic Its not gadgety or gimmicky The GT is more suited to a 50 year old than the SS Wrap up  For me its a great choice with no regrets Enjoy the ride  Got my wife an Ingot Silver 14 Mustang convertible a few weeks ago to replace her aging TaurusNothing but smiles every time she talks about itWeather permitting she drives everywhere with the top down and enjoys the comments she gets about her carIt is quick and smooth and the miles just melt away when going on road trips with the sun shining and the top downHands down the most FUN car in thirty plus years of buying cars togetherLow front end caught her a few days ago when she pulled into a parking spot and drove the front end up onto a curb popping a bunch of things loose in the front endminimum of 1050 to repair but still waiting to get it back and see the full bill   I love my little Mustang Its not powerful V6 but its an original with 17500 miles I bought new at our local Ford dealer here in Sarasota FL It still gets tons of compliments every time I have it out  This is an update  I unfortunately had to sell my 2017  Became too hard to get out of  I loved it in every other way but was hurting my joints the bucket seat is so deep and low  I got a 2017 Honda CRV Touring new 1 class rating and I love it  Its not a convertible but has a sunroof All in all I really like it and my Aunt and Uncle liked it so well for the same reasons they traded in their Lincoln Town Car and bought a new CRV the same as mine top of the line Apparently they liked it Haha PS  I got 24K for my 7 month old Mustang paid 42K for it  Terrible depreciation  43 KBB by owner price  27K which still stinks Be forewarned they allow NOTHING for all those extra whistles and bells I expect the Honda to really hold value  Still was worth the taking the beating to feel and walk betterOriginal reviews follow I had a white convertible medium stone interior since I live at a warm beach  This is an update since I sold it to an 83 year old gentleman who is having the time of his life with it  50K miles with only one AC issue so far I retired from work in Alaska so I wanted all the fresh air and sunshine I could get to make up for all the time spent indoors up in the land of the great outdoors like most everyone I knew  This car fills the bill  Road trips are minimal in Alaska but after 30 years of travel commuting I am staying home except for a trip to Atlanta last summer However I plan to go to Seattle to see my son next Spring and maybe more trips after that For that and other reasons I bought a brand new 2017 Mustang convertible Mainly this is due to all the new accident avoidance technology  Decided on the Ecoboost and I couldnt be happier   I got the Ecoboost without the performance package for a smoother ride but all electronics for 42K Straight line acceleration above usable for merging isnt most important at my age but I did take it up smoothly to the electroniclimited 121 mph once The rear diffuser makes it hug the road even more at high speed Gets up to 32 mpg on highway It is a wonderful car  Even my BMW friends are jealous The open top is the main thing and the GT noise would block out the birds singing  But if someone doesnt have the money to buy a new one I recommend the 2014 highly  Lots of fun for the money It got me to the beach for my every morning walk with the early rays of sun on the water and along the waterfront under the stars at night  My older friend is still loving it and he brags to whoever will listen  This is an update and he still loves that 2014  He has the old fashioned class with sports jacket and roadster cap and is a cool old man  Like the Shelby Mustangs from 19681970 this new one is an odd contradiction Both brutally powerful in 435hp GT form and luxurious at the same time it recalls those late 60s boulevard cruisers more than it reminds me of the more simple honest 50 liter GTs of the 80s or the straightforward 2005 retro reboot That is ok as my 2015 GT Convertible finds me in my mid40s ready for a little more refinement in my car This is my 19th Mustang my tastes have changed and the car has grown up along with me This car is built like an anvil and full of modern conveniences It seems low and heavy at first but soon it shrinks around you and feels like an old pair of Levis took delivery of this few days back It is everything I liked about previous versions PLUS stuff that I had wished for  like the feeling of luxury without compromizing the sportyness Its pure exhilaration as this beauty accelerates like a wild one by the looks yet a seasoned tamed pony by the responsiveness Ive had my eye on Mustangs for years and now finally bought my dream car and not disappointed  It exceeds every expectation  LOVE THIS CAR Its got enough umph but also enough gas mileage averaging 24  Just the right balance  Best thing about this car is that its super goodlooking and just downright FUN FUN FUN to drive You cant go wrong  Its not perfect in every way but still headoverheals in love with this car  Oh and did I mention that I love this car I have had my new Mustang Convertible almost three months It was delivered without the protective Tonneau Covers which fit over the large holes in the frame when the convertible top is in the low position Calls and emails to the dealer asking about this important OEM part which protecets the convertible assembly from weather elements and debris while the top is down have gone unanswered The dealer doesnt have a clue when they will be available and delivered How could Ford deliver a brand new car with missing OEM parts Calls to Ford Consumer Marketing also do not get any help They simply say they are aware of the problem  Bought first week in 2009 Been a great toy car Never had any serious problems When back to the dealer for a loose drivers mirror and a buzzing noise in the transmission which I fixed myself a loose trans inspection plate Some performance and handling mods have been done but its basically all stock  We have put 24000 miles on our 2013 mustang It has really exceeded our expectations The tires are barely worn I just rotated them It feels like it is glued to the road in turns It is heavy and powerful a 37 liter that gets 21 miles to the gallon in city driving Everything works perfectly I dont care for the bluetooth cell phone though too wierd but thats me It is perfect for two people a beautiful car that turns heads 80 feels like 60 mph 100 like 80 so you have to watch the speedometer I am generally pretty cynical about cars but I would recommend this car to anyone that has a little fun money and wants to jazz up their day   Fords complete indifference to customer satisfaction and its insistence in producing an unreliable product has ruined yet another potentially worldclass car This car is a blast to drive but the abysmal quality is surpassed only by the arrogance of its dealers In the first 5 months of ownership I have had the following issues Rumbling and vibration between 50  70 mph Drive shaft replaced at 1100 miles AC not cooling properlyblower fan surges Radio malfunctioned 3 times replaced once Windshield wipers malfunctioned Both front seatbacks have mechanical issues The amount of Convertible cowl shake has gone from acceptable to wet noodle in only 6000 miles   I have owned and driven a lot of cars over the years but this is  the one    I have always been a Mustang fan and this 2014 model is as close to perfect for me as I could get I purchased this convertible with 32000 miles on it and have since put about 20000 miles on it It is very difficult for me to let it stand still in the garage I love driving this car so much I have driven a pick up an economy car luxury car and German sports car and the Mustang is the best road handling of the bunch The acceleration is incredible the braking is strong and the fuel economy averages about 2324 in town Driving with the top down brings you much closer to nature especially living in a place like Central Florida It can get super hot outside but it is difficult or me to not want to put the top down This car definitely draws the looks of passers by and the admiration of others who have not realized their dream of Mustang ownership So far I have not had any mechanical issues to attend to I purchased a Ford Factory Extended Warranty and so far it has gone unused  Have had the car for 3 weeks already been in the shop 5 dayIt has a pulsating vibration between 60 and 75horrible and feels unsafe to driveReplaced driveshaft and rear differential on a car with barely 1000 miles and still not fixedLemon law is next if its not resolved ASAP  This droptop has been sold much fun to drive its an adult version of a gocart The bright red and excellent overall condition gets looks and comments It has 104000 milesstill runs strong and the car is still a sharp looking rideAuto Anything has provided some nice after market items such as new headligh assemblies Ill drive this car til it dies and enjoy every mile  My kids have gotten a little older so I got my 4th Mustang after a 10 year break I picked up a used black GT convertible for a VERY reasonable price and couldnt be happier so far You really cant beat all you can get out of this car for a VERY affordable price I got mine for under 15K in perfect condition and under 60K miles I get more positive comments while out and about than cars I have owned that cost 35K plusSure this car has its drawbacks such as a rough ride no storage space clunky shifting etc I am assuming people who want a refined car with good manners dont want a Mustang this is a good old fashion V8 rear wheel drive muscle car You buy it for fun and it deliversEdmunds asked me to update so here it is Two years later and I still love this car I have logged about 25K miles bringing the total to about 75K I have only had to replace the battery since nothing else This has been a fun reliable car that despite being 10 years old still draws attention and positive comments everywhere I go  The 2015 Mustang GT is finally a sports car The removal of the solid rear axle was the best thing they could have done The rear end hop has been eliminated which has taken a drag racer and made it into a touring car The stock ride is surprisingly comfortable for the driver and passinger Both have heated and air conditioned seats the driver has lumbar support and I dont know why they didnt put one in the passinger seat As always the back seat is more of an ornament than anything else Child seats or a few grocery bags is really all that youll be able to use them for The power and sound is great for a stock car but Id like the exhaust to be just a bit louder The headlights and signals are top notch I have the adaptive cruise control system and its been problematic The automatic windshield wipers will suddenly come on for no reason and the adaptive cruise control shuts down in heavy rain and ocasionally for no reason at all It claims the sensor is blocked The remedy is to pull over and restart the car The adaptive cruise control is operated by a radar head mounted below the grill and it also serves as a colision warning system It beeps and puts a red bar on the windshield Having that shut down during a rain storm is not something you want to happenThe interior far exceeds previous standards and it isnt a plastic rattle trap that weve come to know and love It has plush parts now and real metal The navagation screen is sharp and large enough to read The home screen can be reconfigured with personal wallpapers of anything you want Unfortunately the leather on the passinger side dash started to bubble on the inside front corner Ford had to replace the entire dashboard and the replacement dash has done the same thing Two dashboards before the first scheduled oil change is a bit muchThe car handles well even in normal touring mode There are 3 steering modes and as far as I can tell they just decide how much power steering you have By putting the pedal to the floor the tachometer gage will turn red at night when you touch the red line I havent used the line lock feature and probably wont New tires are expensive The car comes standard with W rated tires and I personally feel that they should change that to the Y performance rating The car is very responsive and I have broken traction once on a tight curve When these tires wear out I will be replacing them with a Y rated tire if for nothing else better tractionThe convertible top has an insulation layer that reduces road noise and makes for a quiet ride I can recommend this car over the Camaro and Challenger The Camaro has 12 more letters but you only gain 20HP  The Camaro isnt as comfortable to ride in and has less features UPDATE I have had a total of 3 dashboards and have been informed by Ford Motor Company that it is normal for the windshield wipers to come on without warning while in automatic mode When I pointed out to the dealership that my wifes Lincoln Navigator L has the same system and has never had any problem and I never had any such problem with my Mercedes that I traded in for the Mustang They told me that this is a Ford not a Mercedes I pointed out that the sticker on this Ford was over 500000 higher than the 2013 Mercedes SLK that I traded in on the car If Ford wants to charge premium prices they need to deliver premium goods I will be getting new tires for the car soon  All these cars have a problem with the AC compressor Ford should recall on this part because is a problem with all the 2010 mustang and is very expensive  Finally the new GT lives up to its reputation and becomes an adult within the global community of entry level super cars The lines and styling are on par with any high end European vehicle yet retains the Detroit muscle look at second glance The interior is no different the word luxurious for an automobile that usually cries out 20 year old kid with a wrench can be used legitimately Controls are ergonomic easy to reach and have a high quality flar The front seats fit like an Italian glove and make high speed cornering slip past with little notice Shaker system needs no further explaining nice The suspension is surprisingly nimble for a heavier car planted but not jarring The IRS is a welcomed addition and long overdue An engine that not only makes short work of highway miles is rev happy willing to grunt out any twisties that youd be more than interested in finding and finding often The 6 speed manual is light crisp and not a chore Reverse issues have been resolved and the added backup camera easily makes one feel in charge in tight situations I cannot fault this new generation of Mustangs other than a few more gallon capacity tank could provide more time carving up pavementbut then againpulling up to a crowded gas station  The smiles and nods of adoration warms the owners decision for their purchase  Just bought the 2016 v6 Convertable Mustang drove it home went to park the car in my garage and I heard a clunk noise in the rear of the car  Wow you can hear it every time you stop the car even at 1 mile per hour  It takes the luster off your new car purchase  Im headed back to the dealer tomorrow morning I hope to get it fixed or get a replacement  It is very fustrating went are so excited about your purchase and it disappoints you  OK just a quick update from my previous reviewSo the dealer found the cause of the rear end noise it was Lungnuts rolling around where the spare tire would be if there was one The car has locking lungs on it so someone put the spare lungnuts in trunk  Boy was I releaved It has been a week since I purchased the Mustang and I have to say It is my Dream Car  It drives great  handles amazingly well  It was warm enough to put the top downwhat a great day cruzing  This car is perfect for my life but not a family car The interior fits like a glove and the back seats are somewhat functional for small people Car has excellent take off and control its a blast to drive I LOVE this car Still going great   Ford finally put quality into the 15 Stang  This sexy eye catcher is a great summer ride Rides and handles like a dream and is extremely comfortable My only complaint is the poor grip on wet and almost dangerous on snowy roads even with their std All Weather Eagle GTs  Not for the faint of heart A red convertible mustang even ten years old now still draws quite the attention Mine is a cop magnet whenever I even consider revving the engine I know they are waiting around the corner for the next youngster in a red car By todays standards a 200 horsepower pony car is by no means american muscle but nothing beats hitting interstate speeds in under 6 seconds with the top downPros the ride is amazing Im used to riding bikes and being able to feel the road Last year I made a deal with a guy he was putting radials on his new gt and sold me his brandnew 2013 gt rims and his Perrelinerozeros for 300 bucks Thus I have a nicer car then 95 of the people in town Its a source of freedom and pride haha But when I park somewhere everybody knows its me Black leather interior black roof the fancy vinylish kind not the cloth top and of course the exclusive red sally paint jobCons The air conditioning can barely keep up with the heat of two passengers on a hot sunny day 105 degrees but thats to be expected with a black topped car Also the engine is limited in fourth gear Ruins my fun But then again theres no need to even be in fourth gear under 85 miles per hour  Top down fun that is worry free Proven V6 engine with automatic is a solid Ford drivetrain Back seat is for children and packages not adults Trunk is small to accommodate the convertible top Head turning and sporty  I had a 69 Mustang Mach 1 428 Cobra Jet This 6 cylinder 306 hp will out perform the big assed Mach 1 I had a racing Corvette pull out in front of me on a deserted state highway I either locked up the brakes or pass him I chose the latter I passed him at 120 and was still accelerating I looked over and his mouth was open It was worth the risk of a major ticket I still get around 27 to 29 MPG while having fun It was used and I got it for 13500 A sweet ride at any price  Great car  Enjoyable toy  I have owned my 2016 GT Premium California Special convertible Oxford White for 6 months now and every day I just look forward to driving itespecially with the top down  It has the 6 speed automatic with 355 LS Rear Axle Nav Adaptive Cruise Control Reverse Sensing Safety systemwell everything except the Performance Package which you cant get with the automatic transmission   Acceleration is awesome  Simply put it looks GREAT drives GREAT and sounds GREAT  No problems or regrets so farThis is the first vehicle built by an American manufacturer that I have purchased since 1985  Toyota and Honda and a number of Mazda Mx5s have been and still are in my driveway however I love this Mustang  Funny storyI rented a 2016 Ford Expedition for a week and was soo impressed with the quality and performance of the big Ford I had to go drive the new Pony Car  Word of advice  Dont test drive one if you dont want to own one  This is a 1 year UPDATE to the original review of my Mustang GTCS Premium ConvertibleÂ  Simply put I love it as much as the day I bought itÂ  It is my recreational sunny day driver so most of the 6500 miles are top down at the beach or open country roads or Blue Ridge ParkwayÂ  People still want to get a closer look at it or ask about it when I stop for gas or at a stop lightÂ  It is everything I expected it to beLooks GREAT sounds awesome handles like a sports car and takes off like a jetÂ  Top quality and no issues or concerns after a year and a halfÂ  GREAT CAR  I purchased a performance package GT convertible in January The exterior body panels were not bonded correctly by the roller at the factory causing noticeable creases at the edges of the trunk passenger door and hood The car has been reviewed by the dealer and 2 body shops and all agree this is a factory defect Problem is that FORD CORPORATE says it is NOT their problem Dealer is working with me to correct the poor workmanship but I am concerned that after the trunk door and hood panels are all reworked and repainted that the value of the car will be depreciated FORD should just take this car back and give me the straight car I paid 44k for  Great car Sold it and it went to South Carolina                                    SOLD THE CAR  A lot of car for the money  You can have three of these compared to the price of one Mercedes SL I had three SLs and do not miss them one bit  Especially the repair bills  Everything was 120000 minimum The Mustang is a a fun and iconic  muscle car for a lot of value for your  With more affordable matinence Love it  If youre looking for a commuter car to take the kids to soccer practice this isnt the car for you It doesnt turn on a dime it doesnt have a lot of trunk space and if youre looking for lots of places to store maps and sunglasses and purses andor man bags this also is not the car for you I didnt want any of the things I mentioned I wanted a convertible with a big V8 a nice loud engine a comfortable front seat and a top that didnt take an engineering degree to put down I got all of that and more with my 2015 mustang gt premium convertible with automatic transmission Manual transmission was not an option as I am somewhat handicapped but who cares  I put the accelerator to the floor and my mustang jumps ahead of traffic with a nice growl of the engine and pushes you back into the seat The interior looks great More leather and less plastic than the 2014 model The audio system is amazing and rumbles just as loud as the engine Putting the top down is quick and easy Ive had the car for about a month and I get compliments at the intersection as well as the parking lot at the grocery store Its a pleasure to drive and I couldnt be happier I had a 1983 mustang gt convertible years ago but there is no comparison Before you get to critical try driving the new GT    Ford informed all Mustang and potentially other makes and models owners in June 2015 that the airbags need to be replaced Since I have been calling to see where they are at on this situation as I do not want my children in the car let alone myself where the very function that is supposed to help you in an accident could result in serious injury or death as stated directly in the 2nd recall letter I received last week I called Fords service division to discuss what they will be doing for their customers and they said nothing but simply having us wait another 6 months for the part to slowly come in As the service lady stated on the phone to me I think this is very irresponsible on Fords part Having their customers drive around a car that could put them at greater risk in an accident than the very accident itself I feel it is unfair as a customer to be forced to drive under these conditions or choose to sell or leave the car in the garage knowing the risks of driving it Ford should allow customers who bought cars to return them or provide us with safer vehicles in the meantime until these issues are fixed  My car has relatively low mileage for an 08 and a new top  It looks great on the street or parked  I have to be good on the road or I getmarked because the car looks like trouble brewing  It can rumble in a purring way or take off when the path is clear  Either way it has always been fun to drive especially with the top down  Only problem was the long wait to have the Takata airbag replaced Ford shouldhave been more supportive  I just took possession of a new 2016 Ford Mustang GT Ruby Red Convertible Yea The mighty Coyote V8 thunders and rumbles even when sitting at idle Everyone loves it It just oozes power and performance Its a trip Punch it and runs  At stops people can hear the powerful engine and they look over often giving a big thumbs up Cruising through town or just on the local boulevards the car catches eyes and ears  You just have to look and listen  Car is gutsy  Wow this car is sweet  Love the new look and I will tell you so does everyone else  I have people commenting all the time about what a beautiful convertible mustang I have  I admit I think I have the best possible color combination red with black premium leather  My vehicle is the 50th Anniversary Editionand boy is it nice  We have a new Cadillac suv and my husband thinks the seats are just as comfortable as that of the Cadillac and that says ALOTI had an older mustang convertible that I sold to purchase the anniversary model and I had no problem selling that eitherYou cant go wrong buying Ford and you certainly wont regret getting the mustang model  I cant say enough good things about what Ford did with the new design it looks and runs awesome  I get classic cars and that is what I like  Until I found my gt well I did some thing I would never do I traded my 1964 ford galxie 500 in great shape but I did find my mustang gt 2002  I thing is the best year I have found I looked at a lot of them and found the 2002 to be like a tank yes its built that good so I did find a classic and I like the idea of having the 289 ci I loved that motor when I was a kid could not kill that motor so I do not have a bad word to say I found the classic I was looking for to keep for many years thank you so much ford you out did yourself  Great auto hugely appreciated  Rides beautifully problem free none since its purchase in 2008 source of many inquiries such as to when are you going to sell it and remains the source of numerous complimentary comments    Update 82017     We have owned this car for a year and my husband still refers to her as his other love  She is better than any medication  Any time we feel bad or just need cheering up we take her for a quick drive with the top down and life is better  Car has held up well and we have had no problems  The climate control works beautifully  I had some doubts given the black leather interior but it stays fairly cool inside even on a hot summer day  Seat coolers help a lot  If we had it to do over we would definitely buy her againOur first Mustang was a 2004 GT convertible 40 automatic  Sassy was a fun little car not a lot of zip but a ton of fun and we cherished her for 12 years  Then we bought our new 2016 GT convertible with the California Special package  With Ruby it was love at first sight  If she were human she would sound like Mae West with that throaty growl  She handles and rides like a dream and that much horsepower should be illegal  We are a retired couple yet we feel like kids when we drive this car just for the sheer fun factor  We love her and plan on keeping her in the family for a long time  I just got my 2015 Ford Mustang Convertible v6 with red exterior and black interior The driving dynamics of this car are absolutely amazing It feels like a true sports car The drive is firm but smooth and when you put your foot on the gas the car just flies I remember when I was taking the car out of the dealer numerous people passing by were commenting how beautiful the car looks in bright red My only complaint is that the interior looks plasticy outdated and kind of cheap The materials are really mehhhwish they had done something to make it look more upscale but all I care about is how it drives and for that this car gets an A  Ive had this car as a rental for 8 days The ride is very smooth and supple There is some cowl shake at times but its mostly well controlled With the top up road noise is muted from the tires but noise comes through the windows easily  The ecoboost 4 cylinder is no where near 5961 in the convertible Best time I got was 69   It lacks any authority in acceleration and is a very poor choice The fuel ole age I got was 193 mpg   My 57 Hemi manual challenger gets that The seats are quite good as I have three bad discs and spinal stenosis and arthritis in my sacrum and these seats were a dream The stereo system leaves a lot to be desired My Boston acoustics in my challenger easily outperforms the shaker system I rented this car to see if I want to buy it I do but not this powertrain Do Im either left to v6 with no options allowed by fire or step up to the GT This powertrain is a joke  I used the Edmundscom price to buy the car through the ford dealership fleet sales manager It could not have been easier The car is one month old now and its a fun car to drive Just put the top down and go   I got the new platinum white color which I love because it has a nice pearl finish  It is FUNNNNN  Fun to drive  Do your research this is a car that dealers like to overprice due to it being eye candy for the dealer lot a great deal can be had all you need is persistence  Dont buy this car  Has been in the shop more times than I care to count  Love my Mustang Ecoboost Convertible  Power and acceleration is probably good for most people  But I wanted a bit more power for hills I drive  I was able to make some easy modifications to improve power  Next step is upgraded turbo  Looks great good visibility for a sports car and I find the convertible very enjoyable  Car drivers car  You can drive the 19992004 Mustang V6 convertible yearround in most parts of the country  Mine has been my daily driver since 2007 driven in Ohio and Tennessee  The heater works great in the winter  no different than in any other car  And as soon as the temps start to climb in the spring down goes the top   It is low to the ground so getting in and out of the drivers seat definitely isnt for people with stiff backs  Maintenance is pretty easy  the engine compartment is big enough to reach all of the spark plugs  In over 100000 miles Ive only replaced the clutch once 39 liter engine with T5 tranny and the top once roughly 1000  Love the car inside and out average fuel milage about 22 miles a gallon city driving Excellent acceleration and handles real well Sound system wonderful Fun car shouldnt get bored of this car First yaaay Second last yaay a href Some say Mat resides in that forest in between car reviews Carwow just park a new car in front of the treeline as bait and he emerges Oh yes How many more convertable reviews Will Matt respondGreat video as always I now want a boost bar for some odd reason Nice review 321st good video I don39t understand the mpg The higher is better  gay Yo matt I like the boost choc Easter egg Haha You39ve done the new BMW 7 Series review new Mercedes S Class review and the new Audi A8 review Any chance of doing the new Jaguar XJ How39s your Porsche going Fixed the roof All good Internet fixed ecoBoost bar matt why is it an auto manual only Hey Mat great work lol on the dolphin jokeQuestion though when are you doing the American muscle comparison now that Chevy Camaro is in UK Convertible Ecoboost Mustang That39s heresy Love the comment quotOK Ford I will raise the Windows thenquot brilliant REALLY UGLY EU Why do we get the Mustang with no LED running lights in the front and with larger side mirrors can39t afford one but his reviews feel like I m driving one This car interior quality is really bad This car is not a good one I think you need to make one longer video with all the space and practicality sections included It makes it easier than going backwards and forwards through videosJust my opinion Rather hav an M4 or C63 Finally an honest review of this car Before Mat says what engine he39s reviewing I39m guessing a 23l EcoBoostMy guess comes from the boost bars D Matt u going bareback Best reviews on YouTube you39re funny haha I hate convertibles that have more than 2 seats it39s just something about those rear seats that disgust me can u make all car cameras to record when u add storage and little software has any1 done it in terms of style it wins over a TT in spades my daughter has one in Texas or had one and it was impossible for a decent child seat Great little review as always cracked up at the headrest dolphin part  Hey Matt I love your reviews Really awesome jokes btw DCould you do one about the Mazda CX 5 I39d like to watch it from you with this new cool features on carwowKeep going like this and i39ll never unsubscribe this channelCheers When will America sort their shit out with interior material quality this looks like a cabin from 2004 citroen c3 wtf are you talking about matt looks like shit Great with the new 4 point system  avoid consider shortlist and buy FYI That is not a 2017 Mustang Very cheap and poor quality great looks overall meh reviews are becoming more entertaining keep up this work carwow it39s great seeing that lame quotnow what do i think of the quot outro replaced with the quotconsider it buy it thingquot Salty price for what you get in this I hope Matt didn39t run anyone over with that Mustang Matt said nothing about it sloppy steering feel when turning around corners Boooooost please make a video on audi rs5 It39s a ford  what did you expect Lol Matt looked like a quotspecial T rex getting in to the back seats  In the early 90s Ford done a mustang that has rear independent suspension  but the 39purists39  over in America hated it as it was slower on the drag strip They was that vocal Ford went back to the old live axel for a 20years Boost bar for EcoBoost  car wow Easter eggs I39d have to get the nonconvertible V8 You don39t buy a Mustang for economy  a href I guess it was bring your kids to work day eh Nice Easter egg Mat  The exposed wires going into the rearview mirror is an example of its poor quality I happen to own an EcoBoost convertible and I must disagree with all the criticism It39s very easy to dismiss the car simply because it doesn39t have the V8 but a V8 for daily use and commuting really doesn39t make much sense since I39m on a budget The only issue with the EcoBoost is the sound which I39m happy to give up for the improved fuel economy would only get the coupe model however if your not loaded the ecoboost would still be a good option if you don39t want to pay £500 tax and funny enough the Americans are all for the ecoboost over the v8 according to sales the whole point of a mustang is that you39re buying into the whole v8 American muscle car thing so a 4cl makes zero sense look at that product placement boost bars nice enough bloke Matt but the reviews are kind of irritating Any mazdas coming soon It39s so American it39s surprising a Big Mac holder isn39t on the options list Looks a bit more practicable than the previous generation in particular the boot openingSame shockingly poor build quality by the looks of things I remember taking the previous gen down the Pacific Coast Highway it was a brand new V6 but the wipers and air con both packed in after 1000 miles I don39t know why I felt like grabbing a boost bar looks cheap All the boost bars haha Eco boost  TKMaxx car That looks like a real crowd pleaser ive sat in the back of a supra feel my pain pls that head rest but made me LOL so much instant like Wow it can talk to dolphins Mat the way you enter the back seat is hilarious Just like how a raptor trying to get into it Can we get more videos pf your personal 911 Seeing a brit driving a mustang is like seeing a fellow yank drink a cup of tea It just seems odd The V6 is a way better option than the 4 and desppite what Ford says gas mileage should be around the same Starts from £35000 and it has manual seats and cheap plastic Ha I think I39ll stick to my 3 series and my X5 thanks I never know if the 39thumbs up or thumbs down39 is for the REVIEW or the CARso thumbs up for review thumbs down for car Interiour looks as cheap as  japanese cars in the 90s lol I still love the car I only come here to find out more about the roof of the porsche come on Mat spill the beans What an incredibly distorted review  I noted most reviews were for GTs  I own an Ecoboost Premium Convertible  Acceleration is soso  Handling is incredible  Only two complaints are the windows controls are too far forward and the antenna is awkward if you have a car cover but it unscrews solving that  Radio actually works fine without it screwed back in  The rear seats cannot be used for passengers but I knew that in buying it  They do make good interior storage  something the old Z3 I had was short of  Gas mileage is killer  I saw acceleration is soso only due to my last car a Lincoln LS with the V8 being no slouch so the Ecoboost doesnt seem to add anything to that  Compared to something else maybe itd be more impressive  So niggling complaints on what has proven to be an incredibly handling car with enough pop to satisfy  Comfort on long drives is much better than expected  the Z3 lacked in that department Review says car acquired in 2016 as page doesnt have 2017 as an option  car was new in August of 2017 I hope matt didn39t hit a crowd Our Matt loves a Boost THE AMERICANS STILL CAN39T MAKE A GOOD CAR bottom line is rubbish car haha gud review Matt a href  I liked the little Boost joke P Matt you love the focus but the mustang is rubbish  also the 23 engine is great in the focus but rubbish in the mustang  dude Wtf  if it39s not british it39s rubbish or what  another entertaining car review by Matt That39s not a 2017 model it39s SYNC 3 on 2017 cars not the SYNC 2 system fitted here I always knew mustang was a piece of shit Great job carwow I was watching Matts reviews since his previous channel and joined carwow from the beginning Guys you really get what it takes to make the show Keep it up Also you should do hot hatchbacks review and head to head Golf R Audi R3 Mercedes A45 AMG and BMW 1M Toyota Corolla has been in production since 1966 but you don39t see them bragging about it In the real world a new Corolla will probably outlast a Mustang looks absolutely ridiculous car LOL when you get into the rear of the car Mat it39s like you held your breath for quite long  safe to drive now after 2 years air bag replaced Took years to replace un safe air bags dealer until bags were replaced offered me next to nothing for it The first thing I did after car was fixed was to trade it off   Carwow Something I39ve noticed is that most American cars don39t pass the big bottle door test I think it39s because in America we don39t sell many beverages in 1 liter bottles the way they are well anywhere else in the world I think American car designers don39t have the liter bottle in mind when they make the door bin Just something I39ve noticed and something you might mention next time you review an American car I love your videos Keep it up Ecoboost zzzz 2 bars of boost  Wanted a newer mustang for quite a while  Found the perfect car for me  Right color deep impact blue convertible a lot of bells and whistles  Price was very good for a low mileage spotless car  Wanted a newer mustang for quite a while  Found the perfect car for me  Right color deep impact blue convertible a lot of bells and whistles  Price was very good for a low mileage spotless car Where could I save money on a new car   This is my first Mustang ever as well as my first convertible  I never had a family member to own one or a close friend  I had friends in high school that did but never rode in one  I rented this vehicle in August of this year and loved it from the start  The feeling of being in a convertible is like no other driving experience I have ever had  I also had never driven a V8 before either  It was a pure endorphinadrenaline rush During my car research I looked also looked at the Camaro 2SS while it was truly a great car it was just too expensive  Another deciding factor in choosing the Mustang was that I had watched A Faster Horse on Netflix  For those who havent watched the documentary it is a great film on how they designed and made the new 2015 model as well as how the original come to be  I just felt more of a connection to the Mustang and honestly Chevy had burned me before on a 98 Malibu I bought new  Biggest piece of crap I have ever owned  So it was an uphill battle for them anyway  So the car itselfbiggest pro to me is the look of the car  I just stare at it in my garage and when I walk up to it at the grocery store  It is a race red black top GT and it is gorgeous in my opinion  Some folks dont like the new design but I would not have considered this car without the new design  The other biggest pro is the power  Why you would buy an Ecoboost or a V6 in a Mustang is beyond me  Yes the gas mileage sucks but man that car rumbles and has sooooo much character that you just dont get in the other smaller engines  It makes me smile every time I push the start button  Finally the other pluses is all the technology in the car  This thing has got it allI wont list them here as you can check it out yourself but a hidden gem I found is that you can program your key so that the car wont go over a certain speed and the radio wont go over a certain level  It also tracks the miles put on the car with that key  So if I want my son who is 16 and gets giddy every time I let him drive it Im in the car with him to drive it without me at least it is the realm of a discussion to be considered  The biggest downside to this car is the ride  It is bumpy and I mean BUMPY  You feel every divot in the road  I know this isnt a luxury carI got that and I wasnt expecting a BMW cloud feeling but for the first time ever I got slightly car sick after a 5 hour drive to see my family for the holidays  We had to stop so I could get rid of the motion headache I had  So that is a big bummer  I feel that if they could have made the Normal mode just a bit smoother on the suspension that they would have a perfect car  Now I own it and I am sure I will get used to it  It does not diminish how I feel about the car overall  I love driving it around town but wont be taking it on any long trips without at least a half a Bonine in my system  I do look forward to taking it to the beachI meanits a convertiblethat is a requirement The gas mileage is what you would expect from a V8not very good  However I was getting 27mpg on the interstate with cruise control on but city is 18 to 19  A few other things to note before I close is that the feel of the steering wheel is great and adjustable with the steering mode  I keep it on Comfortable while driving around town but kick it back to sport when I want to push it  The SYNC system is great but I am still fighting the voice command a bit as she doesnt always understand me  A bit more work could go into that aspect of the software  The biggest thing here is that the car is just fun to drive  I didnt go for practical I went for fun and if you want a fun car get the Mustang GT and if you are feeling really spiritedmake it a convertible I39m disappointed with Ford and this in the US you can get this with the 50 V8 a bit softer than the fastback but it39s a proper V8 PD If this is a 2016 model why doesn39t carry a sync 3 system on it   Exceptional summer toy  I have the 6 speed auto with paddle shifters not the 6M  Also have the performance package with bigger brakes suspension and summer tires A second set of winter or all season tires is a must have because at below 40 degrees the Pirelli PZero summer tires are hazardous to your health  Recommend Pirelli PZero Neros   Acceleration is scary fast especially in the sport mode and drivability is exceptional Its heavier than its Camaro counterpart but much less skittish  Solid dependable easy and funto drive  This Mustang has all of the luxury touches that my Lincoln MKZ has backup camera heated and cooled leather seats navigation sound system dimming mirror memory seats and mirrors etc  With the top down its what youd expect with the top up its as quiet and luxurious as the Lincoln  The auto press consistently gives this car bad marks for a buzzy engine and its infotainment system while ignoring its value and dependability  IMHO they are wrong  If you are looking for this type of car you must consider it  lest you spend thousands more for a BMW Audi or Mercedes or wind up disappointed with a Camaro of Dodge  Drive it  you will be surprised read amazed12122017  Another great summer with the Mustang   Still turns heads after 3 years  No substantive change in my review other than gas mileage has improved somewhat to 24 mpg overall  Of interest  Netflix has a fascinating documentary about the development of the 2015 Mustang called A Faster Horse well worth your time I don39t understand why Ford doen39t give the customer the opportunity to choose higher quality if he doesn39t has a problem with spending more money The GT costs in germany around 50k they just could give things like leather packages etc for 10k extra I39d say a lot of ppl would compare this to a 440i S4 or CLA  Update I had to trade in this car on a new Honda CRV Touring  I just could not get out of it any more My joints were in rebellion so I am just too old 68 for this car with deep and low bucket seats  In fact when I showed the CRV to my Aunt and Uncle they went and traded in their Lincoln Town Car on the exact same thing My Aunt was able to get out with no effort at all with her bad knees That is the ONLY problem I had with using the 2017 Mustang but it was enough  It also depreciated heavily in 7 months from 42K to 24K KBB trade  That part is disgusting but you get nothing for all the addonsbeware Otherwise as my personal car it was the best car I ever owned for fun and for comfortable traveling while in it So read onOriginal review starts here  I loved my 2014 Mustang convertible read the review so I got a new 2017 to have all of the active safety features and other convenience tech What I got was something that is a huge step up in quality  In fact a different machine with the feel of the BMWs Mustang handles better in my opinion  test them I tested and a huge leap above a Camaro  It accelerates smoothly up to 121 mph where it is electronically limited gets up to 32 mpg on highway with super unleaded about 2930 with regular  Handles much better than the GT again try them out side by side  I did several times  GT feels front heavy and bulky This drives like a sports car nimble and quick fun And with a rear diffuser it hugs the road tighter at really higher speeds over 100 mph that I couldnt get near with the 2014 bc the front end would start feeling lighter and drifting Has plenty of storage something lacking in the old Mustang and nonexistent in Camaros  The only things lacking is automatic braking something I will demand in 3 years or I will switch models and lane warningassist  The forward collision warning is great but it just preloads brakes probably a nod to the general macho among Mustang owners but auto braking should be an option for those of us more concerned with being alive and the safety of others than imagined macho  Another after market add on is a windscreen which really makes a difference if you want to communicate or listen to the radio at highway speed  It makes your car a two seater when in place but I never have more than one lady friend at a time riding   Easy to remove but dont get this car for a backseat anyway  One small feature I love is the center console which locks when you hit the door lock fob  I leave the top down a lot when I go into a store This combined with alarms keeps stray hands out that stuff  All in all a wonderful car  After owning 6 convertibles and 4 of them Mustangs this is way far best embarrassing  Alan partridge drives this ford NEW FORD Mustang

            "Who would pay 30000 for an underpowered piece of junk  Sure theyre pretty but where does the 30000 come into place  You can get a BMW for the price of a Mustang  Come on people stop wasting your money  We had the car for a month or so until we noticed the ground effects in the front were warped We were told by Ford that we could either leave it alone or have them replace itI elected to leave it alone Overall we were impressed with the acceleration and amenities of the car along with the build quality of the somewhat dated interior We were happy with the looks of the car and the Mach 460 sound system whether the top was up or down  Bought this car clobbered was hit in side and warped like a banana So I bought another cut them in half and put them together quite a job but the car \ris one of the most fun to drive cars Ive owned love the drop top decent power But sad to say I must sell her I need the down payment for my 2003 cobra convt Rock On FORD  Keep bangin them out  Mustang is fun Negative these huge airscoops  would like to get rid of that but its standard Ford should give their customers the choice if they want that\rSome minor quality issues  squeeking noise in dashboard rear seat with small gap in cloth  fix under warranty Rear solid axle is from the museum  but with US speeds certainly acceptable would not try that on high speed European roads\rNet  a fun car with acceptable negatives  we like to dirve and wait for sun\r   GREAT LOOKING CAR QUALITY IS SOSO  Car has been fun to drive and is generally dependable  Have driven Hondas for the past 10 years prior to this purchase and noticed a significant number of quality issues with the Mustang  Little squeaks rattles and general small parts falling off or out of the vehicle  Dealer calls it normal wear and tear  I bought it in September of 2001 and it has already been in the shop 5 times I noticed that there was a rip in the back seat The car had a bad sincer within the 2nd month When I am rolling the window down or up there is this very LOUD squeeking noise I can not take it through a touchless car wash because it leaks If that is the case then Ford should have their sales people explain that to the buyer before purchasing the car  Funest car I have ever driven  Good power while still posessing much comfort and refinement  Awesome Car  I bought the Mustang GT Vert for one reason to have fun on those summer daysnights \r For performance it doesnt pull like a V8  all Its missing a little grunt For a 260HP3800Lbs ratio I really did not expect for this car to fly \r Interior design is superb especially that I got the tan leater interior I really dont like the fact that Ford had to place the shifter so far An 18 wheeler trucks shifter is much closer \r Exterior designIt takes time before you get used to it Hate those antennas\r For a car under 30K I would recommend the Mustang GT NOTHING ELSE  Retro in style in handling and in functionality Nothing too hitech better than average sound system soso power no its not a 390 or 460 Ford but it can also pass the gas station without stopping for a drink Sitting in the drivers seat reminds me of the view of my old 58 Tbird dual cockpit hood scoop The rides nice the 5speed has a longer throw than I like but then again Im not going to power shift at my age  The rear seat  is nonfunctional I dont have kidsgrand kids to worry about  As far as Im concerned its an extension of the trunk The car is primarily a 2seat sports vehicle thatÂ’s more functional than an old MG and maybe a lot more reliable  tHIS IS MY 3RD MUSTANG THE BEST ONE SO FAR GOT TRIPLE BLACK CONVERTIBLE A GREAT CAR FOR A GREAT PRICE  POOR BUILD QUALITY  So far out of many vehicles this is \rthe best  This is not a car for the \rshyit gets looks ever where it goes  \rIt doesnt matter what age or what car \rthey may be drivingjust two days ago \rit got looks from an Fbody driver  It \ris a blast to drive and comfortable to \rride in  I havent had one problem \rwith it so far  The interior has a \rlittle to much plastic for me but I \rlike the set up  The exterior in my \ropinion is much more agressive than \rthe previous body style  All in all I \rlove this car  this is the best car i have ever owned  I have never owned a better car in my \rlife OK sure Im a little Mustang \rbias since my last car was also a 1991 \rMustang but I wouldnt keep buying the \rsame car if it wasnt satisfying me \rThe ride is smooth The power is \rsupreme The look is dashing What more \rcould you want\r  first ford i ever bought i bought the \rconv v6 with every option at 27000 \rmiles the transmisson failedthe door \rbolts on the hinge fell outthe valves \rrattaled all the time ford really let \rme down with the quality of this cari \rwill not buy a ford again  Im 47 and just bought this car for \rsome driving fun It hasnt \rdisappointed The 5speed shifts very \rsmoothly  The engine growl is very \rpleasing from the inside cabin even \rthough it could be a bit louder from \rthe outside dual exhaust The Mach 1000 \rstereo is awesome  The ride even \rthough stiff doesnt bother me I knew \rbefore buying the car that everything \rwould not be perfect but what is In \rmy opinion the car rides great sounds \ragressive enough has plenty of power \rfor my driving habits and is exciting \rto drive  My Ford Mustang is the most enjoyable \rcar I have ever owned and it is \rpractical too  Reliably built a heavy \rmuscle car lots of pickup and a real \rhead turner  Fully loaded it was a \rgreat deal and continues to hold its \rvalue  I have babied the car in the \rgarage all the time washed every 2 \rweeks and waxed quarterlypristine  I am finally a mustang owner The 2002   Coveting for 3 decades can lead to one \rheck of a fall This ragtop GT has \rsatisfied my every childhood and adult \rexpectation unwaveringly\r The car came out of the factory problem\rfree as specced Not a single problem \rhas arisen in 6 fine months of \rownership Worried about reliability \rForget it My 89 LX 50 has 149k and \ris STILL kicking fast fast fast  \r Fit and finish are excellent as are \rthe price peformance steering \rbraking and handling You want upscale \rluxury and similar features Thats \ryour problem Ill take this Ford and \rretire younger Live below your means \rfolks The real fun is behind that \rchromed galloping pony  I am one of those poor bastards having \rto commute 50 miles up and down every \rday What better way than to do it in a \rMustang convertible It sounds great \rboth with the top up and down not in \rthe least because of the great Mach \rsound system\r My wife loves it too especially when \rshe straps the kiddy seats in the back \rthey actually fit and the girls sit \rthere with the top down trying to keep \rthe long hair out of their faces You \rshould hear them screaming Yahoo \revery time she pulls up from a traffic \rlight  My whole life from the time i was 8 I \rwanted a Firebird I wouldnt even \rconsider a Ford Then my friend let me \rdrive his V6 stang and i was like hmm \rSo i test drove a gt and i couldnt \rbelieve it This is the greatest car \rid ever driven And fuel economy is \rgreat compared to the Jeeps and trucks \rim used to driving I say buy a \rmustang and buy one now  This has been a great car for the two   After owning a True Blue  Graphite \rinterior convertible for 6 months we \rhavent had any problems or trips to \rthe dealer for repairs  Performance \rcould be better especially since other \rbrands are getting over 250HP from \rsmaller V6 motors my 11yearold \rAccord is faster  However since this \ris a relatively economical model we \rdont expect as much  We just drove \r800 miles on a recent trip and it ran \rsmooth and strong on the freeway  It \rwas really great winding through wine \rcountry in central CA with the top \rdown warm sun beautiful ride  This has been the best new car I have \rever owned  Style good fuel miles \rsounds great not like an electric \rrazor  For a performance car it has a \rgreat ride and is comfortable  \rStandard features are very good  Loads \rof aftermarket parts to upgrade  With \rage the Mustang only gets better  \rThanks Ford  This is my third mustang  I went from \rthe standard v6 coupe to the v6 coupe \rpremium convertible to the now v8 \rpremium convertiblewhich is no \rother way to describe than Simply \rAmazing  The v6 is goodbut once \ryou drive the amazing v8 you will not \rsettle for anything less  If you can \rafford the extra cash I highly suggest \ropting for the more agressive v8  Overall a very fun car  Jet black wblack interior looks sharp  Handles \rgreat love the way it corners  The V6 is pretty good and given the cost of \rinsurance for the V8 its very acceptable  The MACH sound system is \rfantastic  Have had only a few problems with the   Have had only a few problems with the   I think it is a great car I feel like \rdriving it more than even my favorite \rcar the corvetteit has filled my every \rneed and more and for less than 25000 \rI dont think u can get a better deal\r off the list of most affordable \rconvertibles there is no car faster or \rbetter than the mustang  Great overall car You get a great \rlooking car tire smoking power all \rthe options plus more and a \rconvertible for a great price Wish \rthey changed the interior a bit more\rfrom the previous 9498 Stangs to \rgive it that new feeling but all the \rcontrols are easy to use and access so \rits not too big of a deal The new \rexterior took a bit of getting used to \rwhen they first came out but I love it \rnow You definetly get a lot of looks \rand nice comments Also handles good \rand fuel economy is what you would \rexpect from a V8 sports car  We recently purchased a 1998 GT manual   Styling has great appeal Great   First of all I really got a great deal \ron my new Mustang and highly reccomend \rTraedwell Ford of Mobile AL Went back \rto the Mustang GT after a few years off \rand it as sweet as I remember it I \rcould do without the caution tags on \rthe visor \rthat will not seem to come off Also \rthe stereo buttons placement on the \rstereo make it very hard to see the \rstereo display when you are making \radjustments I hate the seatbelt \rwarning sound when you are not wearing \ryour belt and that the seat will not \rlay back Please remember that the good \rover lap the bad by far but just some \rthings to consider before you buy  Love the exhaust sound and there is \rnothing like the wind blowing through \ryour hair in a convertible  It turns \ralot of heads and I get a lot of \rpositive comments from people  Gas \rmileage is excellent near 28 mpg on \rthe highway Small issue with drivers \rside window that I need to get fixed \rbut otherwise a very fun car  This is the first car that I have bought \rand am more or less satisfied with \rwhat I have gotten I think the exterior \rdesign is great and has not looked \rthis good in years On the other \rhand the interior design is horrible \rand needs significant improvements \rand more aminities  Trust meDo NOT buy this car I \rpurchased this car used with 89k At \r100k I had to replace the engine  Two \rmonths later I began having major \rtransmission problems Buying this \rvehicle was the WORST financial mistake \rI have EVER made I sent it away to \ran auction two days ago so buyers \rBEWARE  The ford mustang is my first car and i \rneeded to have it because i was brought \rup with one My mom had an 82 mustang \rit lasted 17 years before it bit the \rbig one The GT mustang is great I \ronly have one problem i think that the \rinterior design could be a little \rbetter But otherwise its the best car \ri have ever seen and i love cars You \rshould really get one there great  My wife and I have enjoyed playing \rarround in our new sports car My \rmom says I act and even look ten years \ryounger The performance of this car \rcan not compare to that of the 60s \rand 70s but it sure handles better  I was looking for a weekend toy really \ran excuse to buy a 3rd vehicle  With \rthe SUVs in the driveway we wanted \rsomething a little more fun to drive   \rWe priced and test drove the European \rconvertibles such as BMW VolvoSaab \rand Mercedes  Dealers are pretty proud \rof these cars in Houston TX Just \rcouldnt convince myself that these \rcars were worth 4555K  It hit me why \rnot a Mustang GT convertible  Test \rdrove a GT coupe that afternoon  no \rconvertibles in stock  and was \rhooked  Convertibles came in next week \rand took one home with us  Sweet car \rand half the price of the Euro boys  Tis my fourth Mustang convertible and   After owning this for two and a half \ryears I still find myself excited to \rdrive my Mustang  It is a great car to \rcruise in or to take to the track  It \ris an absolute joy to own  had 2 other new stangsmach tapecd   Most fun car I have ever owned Looks \rgreatruns great gotten tons of \rcompliments on how good it looks  I bought this car used with 3200 miles \ron it  Saved about 5k over a new \rone  The car has been ok since Ive \rowned it I have a couple problems with \rit though  First is the throwout \rbearing noise which Ford refuses to \radmit to hearing  Second is a rear \rchassis squeak that they of course \rcannot hear neither  I rarely drive \rthe car now so these nuances are not \rthat big of a deal  I just installed \rSteeda Sport Springs and I cant \rbelieve the improvement  Ford should \rhave put these on from the start\r Otherwise I love the exhaust note and \rthe power  I bought my 2000 V6 Mustang new since \rthen I have had nothing but \rproblemsAC went out the second time \rI used it the power driver seat had to \rbe replaced 3 times the engine valves \rrattle the convertible top had to be \rreplaced after 6 months because it was \rsplitting at the seams the CD player \rhad to be replaced twice  I could go \ron and on but way waste my time  In \rclosing the car is for sale now and I \rwill NEVER by a FORD product again  Trust me everyone if you have the \rchance I strongly suggest you get you \rhands on one  I love this car I was origiannlay \rlooking for a Pointiac trans Am but \rafter driving this car I fell in love \rright away  The exhaust note is \rawesome and I really like it driving \rthrough tunnels or under over passes \rand giving it lots of gas  This is the best car ive ever driven it is stylish and great to drivei love my \rmustang  Mustangs are the most comfortable cars   Great car if you can afford the \rinsurance and dont have children  Not \ra lot of room to haul anything so \rdont plan any trips with more than two \rlightly packing adults  I think this drop top is a great bang \rfor the buck It has aggressive and \rbeautiful styling and will give you the \rpower you want I love the shifter But \rthe cupholders are too close to it \rSomeone in the ford company messed up \rhere When you shift to 2nd or 4th you \ralways hit it cup leading the contents \rto conveiniently spill all over But i \rfind the interior to be comforting it \rflows away from you leaving the \rfeeling you have more space This car \rwill make you crave what the 8 has in \rstore The leg room is no problem but \rdont place to be bringing anyone \raround in the back seat comfortably \rbut then again this is not to be \rmistaken with a minivan  I bought this car for my wife in 2000 \rThe next day went out and put 2 stage \rflows on it to make it rumble  It \rguzzles gas is a little sluggish on \rthe bottom but once it gets going it \ris fairly fast  My Ford F150 has more \rtorque and is quicker off the bottom\rOverall it is fun to drive but is \rvery loud ragtopand the tranny has \ralready gone out Thank god it was \runder warranty  It has been a fun car \rbut it rattles a lot and feels loose \rwith only 27000 miles I wont buy \ranother one  My first car in 1979 was a 65 Mustang \rcoupe my dad sold to the little old \rlady that I purchased it from new  I \rdebated on whether or not to spend my \rmoney on vintage or new but not for \rlong once I drove the new  This car is \rpure joy to drive around town and on \rthe open road Go 5 speed I live in \rcity and its no big deal  Only use \r1st occassionally normally starting in \rsecond try it  Overall its a very fun car to drive \ron smooth twisty roads with the top \rdown  Throw in the Mach stereo system \rand a lot of fun can be had  To get \rthe most fun out of this car it needs \rto be pushed high revs and twisty bits \rof pavement will plaster a smile to \ryour face  As far as practicality is \rconcerned this car leaves a bit to be \rdesired  The trunk is small and the \rback seat is barely usable  Get this \rcar off of smooth surfaces and squeaks \rand rattles abound  The FE isnt too \rbad for a V8  If youre looking for a \rfun RWD convertible that has great \rlooks a decent interior a great sound \rsystem youll probably be satisfied \rwith this vehicle  I love everything about my car  It is \rthrilling to ride in it with my \rconvertible down I am a true \rconvertible lover  My favorite view of \rmy car is when I am looking at the rear \rlights especially at night matched with \rthe light on my aftermarket rollbar  \rIt is absolutely adorable  I love \rvrooming around in it and hearing the \rengine  It really turns heads and the \rleather interior is very comfortable  \rThere are many mustang pony markings on \rmy car  I like running my hand over \rthe rised pony in the center of my \rsteering wheel  If I could do it again \rwould I still buy a mustang \rconvertible  In a heartbeat  Interior needs update is oldfashioned \rlooking  Gauge layout is blah  Seats \rhave no lateral support  When buying a used car or any car \rsome people get good ones some get \rbad  I know several people who are \rhappy with their mustang v6 and dont \rhave any problems  I however had \rproblems  The exhaust manifolds went \rbad twice but were covered under \rwarranty  After the warranty expired \rat about 45000 miles the transmission \rstarted slipping when you tried to \raccelerate hard and the valves started \rto make noise  The dealership told me \rthat the valve problem is common with \rthe V6  It cost around 500 to fix  \rThe top did make some noise around \r48000 miles but it was an easy fix  I get lots of looks and comments at \rstop lights  Nice acceleration  \rIncredible sound system  Not too bad \rgas mileage all things considered  My \rmineral grey with black convertible top \rand black leather interior stang looks \rgreat  My main complaint is that on 3 \rseparate occasions the gas flow to the \rengine shut off when I was decelerating \rwith the clutch pushed in  probably a \rcomputer chip problem that can be fixed \rby the dealer at nocost to me  I plan \rto keep this car forever although I \rwill likely be buying a 4wheel drive \rEscape for winter driving  Over the years I have owned the \rfollowing Mustangs 1966 2892 bbl \rconv 1969 351W4bbl Mach I and 1973 \r351C2bbl conv  Of all the Mustangs \rthe 1999 GT conv is the best  A \rsplenid combination of historical \rMustang styling and modern technology \rthis automobile is truly a delight to \rown and drive  Additionally dealer \rservice and warranty work is absolutely \rflawless  Everyone should own one of \rthese  I have owned my Mustang convertible for \rtwo and a half troublefree years This \ris a well made car for its level of \rvehicle  I owned Cadillacs previously \rand while this isnt a Caddy it is \rexactly what I wanteda fun \rconvertible with lots of power  I have \rfound the Ford brand to be high quality \rand the dealership to be very good \rWould highly recommend this car  Great car to drive during the   I am 23 and within reason this is \rdefinitely my DREAM car I love the \rfact that I see all kinds of different \rpeople driving around in a Mustang\rfrat boys hot college chicks moms \rdads even the occasional Senior \rThis car is fun fast and definitely an \rattention getter I considered the GT \rbut decided the V6 was plenty of power \rand was told by a few other people that \rthe little extra power you get is not \rworth the BIG insurance increase and \rfrequent stops at the gas station If \ryou like to live life with the top \rdown this car will make you happy \revery day  It is the best car money can buy  fun to own and drive  I got my GT as a graduation present and \rI love it It is by far the best car \rthat can be purchased for the money \rThe steering and braking are superb \rlooks unique and stylish and is very \ruser friendly as a daily driver I put \ra lot of miles on m GT because I \rcommute a lot and so far it has been \rvery reliable  I BOUGHT MY CAR NEW AND AFTER I GOT \r20000 MILES ON MY CAR I HAD A HARD \rTIME KEEPING IT ON THE ROAD I TOOK IT \rIN AND HAD FRONT IN ALIMENT AND I \rBOUGHT NEW TIRES THE PROBLEM WAS STILL \rTHERE NOW I HAVE 60000 MILES ON IT AND \rTHE CAR WAS OUT TO KILL ME\rTOOK IT BACK AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS \rTHE RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER CONTROL ARMS \rWERE NEEDING TO BE REPLACE ALSO FOUND \rI HAD A REAR MAIN SEAL TRANSMISSION \rLEAK AND OIL LEAK TOO I ALSO HAD TO \rHAVE AN IDLER PULLEY REPLASED AFTER \rALL HAVE BEEN DONE I STILL HAVE A \rLITTLE PROBLEM PULLING TO THE RIGHT\rTHANK GOD FOR EXTENED WARRANTIES YOU8217RE \rGOING TO NEED IT\r  If youre looking for a fun reliable \rconvertible this is the car for you \rNice solid ride with plenty of power \rNot ideal for long road trips but \rwell worth the lack of space I would \rnot purchase any other convertible  I like the way the car looksinside and \rout I like the way  feels inside and \rthe way that it handles  The power \rdrivers seat has so many adjustments \rthat if my wife drives the car it \rtakes quite a while to get the seat \rreadjusted properly  It has a nice \rsuspension where you dont feel every \rseam in the pavementon local roads or \ron the highwayPlentyOfPower I bought \rthe car with 39000 miles on it  The \rpower top works great  It would be \rnice if the cover for the top fit \rbetter  If you snap it in place it \rpops back out  I scrapped the cheap \rmaterial seat covers for new leather \rones  Big improvement  The best time of a day is when I drive   Much more power than my old 98 Z28   I recently bought my 99 Mustang GT\rConvertiblehave yet to be\rdissappointedIts beautifulthe\rinterior is roomy enough for 2 up\rfronthoweverI quickly abandoned the\rpossibility of fitting 2 comfortably in\rthe backIt can be done but only by\rscooting the front seats up\rconsiderablywhich could be bearable for\rshort tripsbut not on long onesTrunk\rspace also leaves a bit to be\rdesiredThe stereo systems great for\rfactory the exteriors hotoutside\rnoise is pretty minimal considering it\ris a convertibleIm impressedMy beauty\ris definitly a headturnerI look\rforward to thousands more miles with him  I have owned 2 Mustangs a 00 V6 which\rhad no problems and a 01 GT which was\rtowed 7 times in 15 years had the\rT45 trans replaced trans seized at 50\rwhich shattered the clutch It\rfelt like Id jammed the brakes on at\rmax strength Im lucky I wasnt in\rtraffic Warranty was denied cost me\r4500 the car refused to start 5 times\rin 4 of the cases the engine wasnt\rturning over battery only died once\rtorque converter failed a fuel pump\rgave out brakes disks needed\rto be replaced Also note the steering\rwheel can lock in such a way that a pin\rblocks the key from turning if this\rhappens to you   try turning the\rsteering wheel until it lets you turn\rthe key  I received my mustang in 00 for Mothers \rDay I it a dream to drive It is laser \rred with a gold stripping kit \rBeautiful car It is not driven in the \rwinter unless it is a must and only has \r21300 miles on it I recently put new \rtires on and and it feels brand new \rIn the summer I love to put the top \rdown place my black boot on and ride \raway I would recommend the convertible \rto any one because it is sporty classy \rand a wonderful ride and mucho speed  Beautiful car great ride I havo no \rmajor complaints here I love mt 2003 \rGT Premium Convertible  Since wanting a GT since I was a kid   After a 2000 LX convert I recenty  \rgot a brand new GT convertible BBB \r got a great deal over the web I \rstill wish there was abit more effort \rput into the interior design the \rleather seats are far more comfortable \rthan the cloth ones I had The \rdifference between the 190 HP 38 and \rthe 260 HP 46 is very nice The car \rhandles incredibly well right out of \rthe factory  the feel of the LX and \rthe GT canno be compared I hate to \rsay it but the LX handles more like \rthe tyoical US car even with rear\rwheeel drive The GT truly handles \rthe road  I love my little Pony car \rtheres nothing else like it available \rfor the money today It is a legend  I just got my new 2003 Mustang GT   I purchased my Mustang GT Conv over a \ryear ago So far it is the best car I \rhave onwed over Camaro TransAm and \rHonda It handles best on the market \rand blows the doors of most other \rcars The back seat is quite small but \ris far less noiser than any other \rconvertable I have owned  purchased first mustang convertibleHave read   I bought this car as a fun car I \rfind it a pleasure to drive especially \rwith the top down  The V6 is one of \rthe best in its class and has plenty \rof pepIf you want to race buy the \rGTYes it has inadequate storage \rthats not what its built for Its \rbuilt for pleasure not hauling the \rfamilyFor the priceI dont think \ryou can find a better looking more \rreliable convertiblePeople might \rimmediately shout SebringMy answer \rbuy a Sebring if you LOVE your service \rmangager because youll be seeing alot \rof himBeen there done thatFord \rhas done a good job of putting all of \rthe essential options into an \raffordable package  Excellent value for the money  Great \rstraightline performance but handling \ris fairly poor  Car sits too high and \rhandling suffers from lack of \rindependent suspension during hard \rdriving  Surprisingly good \rreliability owned one for over 35\ryears and hexperienced only one \rproblem convertible top motor died \rbut replaced under warranty  Fun To Drive  Like back in the   i was very impressed with this vehice   The car is extremely fun to drive    I totally love my car It is a   Ive had my 2000 Mustang Convt for one \ryear now  Its a fun car to drive I \rlove having a convertible  Great \rexterior design but again interior \rdesign Lots of aftermarket accessories \ravailable  The car itself gives me a \rmediocre driving impression  Strong V6 \rthough  However it has poor wet \rweather traction I would recommend it \rto someone who like a an affordable \rfun nice looking coupleconvertible  Ive had this great car for a year and \r3 months now It was two years old \rwith 32k miles and I have since added \ranother 22k miles I have experienced \rabsolutely no problems and the car \rruns great A couple months back I \rgot into a car accident but the car \rproved to be incredibly resilient The \rcar has never given me any reason to \rfeel unsafe even at very high speeds \rupwards of 130 mph  Call it a mid life crisis but after \rtwo family sedans and an SUV it was \rtime to return to a sports car  I had \rowned a Vette in my younger days but \rmarriage and a family brought changes \rto my lifestyle  Now that they are \rnearly grown my hands yearned to grasp \rthe wheel of a sports car  Not quiet \rbeing able to afford a Vette and still \rhaving two kids currently at home the \rFord Mustang GT convertible was my \rchoice    You cannot get more fun in a car for \runder 25K Sticks to the road just \renough torque to feel racy and a great \rsound system with a muscular punchy \rstyling This car is solid and \rremains tight One exception squeeky \rwindows that the dealer fixed  But not \ra single other problem since October \r01 Essentially Ford focused on the \rthings a buyer like me wants so there \rmay be some paint runs under the trunk \rbut who cares Do I wish it had about \r40 more horsepower Yes its not quite \ras fast as its looks suggest but that \ris being picky Buy the GT for a few \rgrand more if that is your concern \rOverall a surprisingly great buy  When I purchased my mustang in 1997 I \rwas told by many people that I would \rnot be happy owning a Ford  Of course \rthey said found on roadside dead \retc  I loved the way the car drove \rand I six years later still love it  \rSo far the only things I have had to \rdo in six years is change the oil the \rtires and the battery  NOTHING has \rbroken the radio AC and top all \rstill work fine as well  Yes there \ris some leaking now  Also surpising \ris my gas milage  Its a 6cyl manual \rso it should get good milage  It gets \rGREAT milage  32 highway 25 city  I \rcould not be happier    Very very fun car to drive Gas miliage\ris not that great but you cant expect\rmuch from a V8 Tremendous amount of power   I bought this car after I turned 50 and \rI wanted to be cool well I am cool but\ralso very frightened of the fast \rdriving everyone else does here in \rFlorida I travel over 30 miles one way \rto work and I would keep this car if \rthe gas milege were better I love to \rput the top down and just enjoy this \rgreat Florida weather\r  THIS CAR WHILE NOT TERRIBLY  \rEXPENSIVE  GIVES THE DRIVER AND EDGE IN \rPARACTICALLY ALL SITUATIONS VS  HIGH \rPRICES COMPETITIVE CONVERTS   SURE \rGETSA A KICK OUT  OF LEAVING THIS FAT \rHOGS IN TAHE DUST COMPARITRATIVELY \rSPEAKING  OF COURSE  ONE DOESNT \rTACKLE A PORCHE OR THE LIKE  ANWAY \rITS A INEXPENSIVE  NICE CAR  CANT \rFIGURE OUT WHY THE CARAMERO BIT THE \rDUST  This is my first convertible and I love\rit  It has plenty of power for me and\ris a real head turner especially with\rthe top down  I love its sporty and\rsexy style    Mustangs are the best cars ever made  I love all convertibles but nothing \rcarries the pizzaz of a Stang \rConvertible  Ours is a Redfire \rMetallic with two tone leather \rinterior  Big V8 with a savvy 5 speed \rtransmission  Plenty of power but \rmore importantly its distinctly \rAmerican and a hoot to drive  At the \rSonic everybody and I mean everybody \rlooks at this car not the other so\rcalled convertibles\rStangs rule  excellent fun to drive fast the only \rcomplaint is small gas tank  This car is fast and fun  If I had to choose one sports car this \rwould be what I would choose Im glad I \rown a Mustang because as a little girl \rI wanted a sporty car but one that was \rfun to drive With the Mustang you get \rboth  I am a mother of 3 children We are   Great car especially when you live in \rSouthern California and drive with the \rtop down most of the year  Love the \rway it handles although I wish the GT \rsuspension wasnt as hard \rridingespecially over country \rroads  Some minor rattles but this is \ra convertible  A real plus is that the \rV8 engine uses regular fuel  That is \ra big savings just in itself Would \rdefinitely buy another down the road    I LOVE IT LOTZ   I love this Car it Has everything you   This is a fun car to drive Performance \ris superior Reliability has been \rgreat I actually own a 1998 Mustang GT \rconvertible with 51000 miles so I know \rof what I speak Very comfortable for a \rsports car I still get lots of stares \rand thumbs up when I drive  Fun car to drive  the engine sounds   I just bought this car and I couldnt \rbe happier I had a 2003 Matrix and it \rhad no power now I know what its like \rto have a real car   Overall this is a great car but I \rwould recomend having another car for \rthe winter The car has an extremely \rresponsive throttle making the car \rvery quick There are many affordable \raftermarket upgrades for this car My \rcatalytic converters became stopped up \rAnd Ive heard other other mustangs \rhaving the same problem Othe than that \rI havent had anyproblems with the car \rIf you buy a sports car that has a v8 \rengine you shouldnt expect to get great \rgas mileage I got about 14 miles in \rthe city and 18 on the highway220 \rbut I was accelerating a lot so if you \rdry the car easier you could probally \rget about 250 miles on a full tank     I purchased the Mustang convertible \rwith the pony package GT hood scoop \rGT wheels and ponies running down the \rside at bottom of doors in silver with \rdark charcoal interior  It is a \rbeautiful car I get lots of looks from \rpeople on the road  It handles very \rwell is quick and peppy I would \rdefinitely reccomend the 5 speed manual \rtransmission in a 6 cylinder      This car is my 3rd Mustang I havent \rfound another car as fun to drive as \rthis one in this price range Its got \rthe sport the muscle the look and \rthe looks I get while driving it are \rworth every pennygood and bad and \rwith all of these great qualities it \ralso has class A little difficult to \rachieve so many different \rcharacteristics in just one \rvehiclewell Ford has managed to \rproduce one This car is loads of fun \rto drive and the most reliable  I love the look style and sound of \rmy yellow mustang convertible  I find \rit a pleasure to drive  Fun car to drive  No major problems  After buying this car I joined a \rMustang Club and proceeded to make \rmodification upon advice of other \rmembers  My car stays garaged more of \rthe time than not due to Car Show

it\rNegatives lacks headroom when the top\ris on the neck support on the front\rseats are poorly designed and the car\rlacks cargo space\rBiggest positive the high performance\rdressup and aftermarket resources to\rpersonalize this car are ENDLESS   We love everything about our mustang \rIt handles great and is lots of fun   This mustang is awesome the \rconvertible except it has very slow \rpickup rates  I seem to have to floor \rit for a few seconds before it even \rstarts going fast  It is a little \rdisappointing  Heres a tiptry not to \ruse the air conditioning because it \rdrains the gas and lowers performance  I love this car  I think the   Ive only had the car for about 2 \rmonths but it has been an amazing \rexperience since I bought it Ive \rrecently upgraded the exhaust system to \ra set of Flowmasters and they even make \rthe car more sweet to drive The only \rqualm I have is that my back seat and \rtrunk are tiny  This car was fun to drive stock but I \rneeded more  After a

\rIts simply the best 4 seater \rconvertible for the money  The car \rlooks great with the top down and the \rauto top is easy to use and opens \rquickly  It has enough power to be fun \rbut not dangerous  Its a solid smooth \rride which is exceptional for \rconvertibles  the top is a little load and it would   SEATS ARE VERY COMFORTABLEDESPITE THE   Very good car better than I expected   I love this car I have owned 15 cars   If you dont require the power of the \rGT this car should work for you Total \rblast to drive  no regrets on giving \rup the practical sedan for this one  I have driven my car for about 8 months   This is a small car with a big car \rride Plenty of power Fun to drive \rHad a few things go bad AC trans \rstarter  alternator Ford replaced \rtrans Other costs less than a 1000  I went into the dealership with a fixed \rprice on my mind  the invoice  I was \rable to get the actual invoice price \rfrom the internet  With that and the \roffer of 3000  I was

\renthusiasts  I always wanted one since highschool \rNow in my 30s I finally got one \rTradition and Realability is the reason \rwhy I bought one If you want power on \rthe road get one If you want others \rto see who is driving next to them at a \rstop light get one If your tired of \rpaying crazy money for a simple tuneup \ror maintanence for your foreign car \rget one If you want style

looking for something more fun   Much faster stock than a Civic and \rcan buy used for cheap Handles well \reasily modified to be very fast Its \ra bit heavy but turning and braking \rare still good Cheaper than a Camaro \rand more easily modified  This car is great it runs really   After driving SUVs and sedans for over \r15 years and reaching close to 40 and \renjoying my Camaro in 1994 I wanted to \rgo back to an inexpensive sport \rvehicle I Love the ride and comments \rabout my mustang and my 17 year old \rdaughter loves to practice her driving \rin it also  I bought this car new in Feb 2000 and \rhas been a great car Still has \roriginal brake pads after over 85000 \rmiles plus does not burn any oil Nice \rand comfortable with plenty of pickup \rfor passingLooking forward to

boy racers \rstanding Now where can I get me the \rmoney for a Saleen SC  At least the car look good  My wife \rbought this car before we were married \rand as soon as she could she pawned it \roff on me  It doesnt handle well  My \rroad to work is twisty and I had always \renjoyed seeing what my car can do on \rit  The mustang handles like a brick  \rOn the inside the seats are not very \rgood on the lower back and the \rseatbelts tend to turn in such a way \rthat when you close the door the buckle \rjams the door and cuts into the \rpaneling  All in all I have not \renjoyed this car  I bought this car in January 2001 and \rfor the most part its been a great \rcar Been through several accidents \rand still in one piece never an \rinjury  Had to have the brakes \rreplaced and the engine serviced once \rbut thats really it Runs well \raccelerates really nicely a fun car \rto drive especially in electric \rgreen I just wanted to reply to \rsomeone saying that it ran well in \rrain and snow it DOESNT run in rain \ror snow very very touchy spins out a \rLOT Im trading it in this year for \rsomething with AWD For what I used it \rfor though it was a great car  Long before the time I was old enough \rto even sit behind the wheel of a car I \rdreamed of owning a mustang That dream \rfinally came true and I could not be \rhappier This 2000 silver mustang \rconvertible with a black top is simply \ramazing From performance to looks I \rbelieve that body style of the mustang \rfrom 9904 is one of the best body \rstyles since the mustangs of 196412\r67 I wish the gas mileage was a little \rbetter but I can not complain because \rI am finally driving a mustang  I have had a great experience with this \rautomobile\r It has turned heads from day 1 \rEverybody comments on this car \respecially the sleek look and its curb \rappeal\r I have never had any major issues with \rthis car The drivers door window motor \rwas replaced shortly after I purchased \rother than that it has been no issues \rat all This is a FORD product it was \rbuilt well  This car is a real head turner  and \rwithout any nonfactory adjustments \rGreat styling a comfortable ride and \rreasonable fuel efficiency make this \rcar a great package The 6 cylinder is \ra little tame but makes for an \rexcellent cruiser to take on long \rtrips  especially along the beach or \rother scenic areas Once you go \rtopless its hard to go back  Its a blast to drive and a real head \rturner espically with the top down  Big \rdown side to me no available Roll Bar \roffered and its a royal pain in the \rto put the tops Boot Cover on  The \rV6 could use some more HP but the gas \rmileage is good and the insurance rates \rare lower than witha V8  Just gets \rbetter with age  Recaro seats in front \rwith be a nice touch and offer bette  I bought this vehicle used in 2003   I wanted a convertible  I read the V8 \rwas a more reliable engine so I went \rwith that  After rebate and dealer \rdiscounts the Mustang was 2k LESS \rthan a comparably equipped Miata  I \rfeel safer in a larger car  I can pass \rother cars on the freeway quite easily \rnow  Love driving with the top down \rand the exhaust sounds great  Not the \rbest looking inside or out  And not \rthe most reliable compared to \rJapanese  But thousands of  cheaper \rso figured that would offset  I love my Mustang I only drive it in   this car is an excellent car i wouldnt   Ive owned a 2001 Mustang Convertible \rfor about a year now and I must say it \ris a vast improvement over the boring \rFrontwheel drive sedan I owned \rbefore The power with the V6 is \radequate though not stellarbut a \rfew aftermarket performance parts can \rsolve that problem The car is also \rsurprisingly sturdy handling a \rcollison with a toyota pick up with \rminimal damage By far its best \rattribute is its agility  We bought the car new and 8 hours \rlater I had my first speeding ticket \rWhat a fun car to drivewith a radar \rdetector  Interior fit and finish is \rlacking and the convertible top allows \rany and all outside noise to enter \rbut thats where the Mach stero system \rshines It drowns out all the outside \rnoise while you put the car through \rits paces The V8 provides plenty of \rzip We had a 6 cylinder version of \rthe 1996 Mustang for 4 years and it \rstruggled to get out of its own way \rIn my opinion the 6 cylinder version \rof this car is a big waste of your \rmoney Be sure to include an extra \r250 for a good radar detector  I bought this car new in 2000  Its \rheld up well but not great and has \rbeen good transportation  The fact \rthat its stylish and performs well \rdoesnt hurt either  As a \rconvertible its as solid as anything \relse on the road today at least in the \runder30k market  The interior is \rgreat  its comfortable and it has \rsolid ergonomics  That being said I \rdinged the interior a couple of points \rbecause of cheap materials and \rappearance  All in all a great car \rfor the money  Love the look of this year before it \rbecame more angular If youre going to \rbuy a Mustang why would you get \ranything less than the GT  V8 engine \rThis car has great power and is a blast \rto drive One of the best convertibles \rin this price range  This is the best car i have ever owned  I bought this car two years ago with \ronly 8500 miles It was babied by the \roriginal owner I have put another \r7000 miles on it during the non\rwinter months Great to drive ultra\rsharp looking have not had one \rproblem yet Best present I ever \rbought for myself  After turning 40 Momma decided she \rwanted to pick out her own car She \rchose a ragtop 40th anniversary pony\rShe didnt want the GT so she chose the \rPremium edition convertible black top \rblack paint black leather The car \rdrives great but after driving a GT \rdemo while waiting for this vehicle to \rcome in  well theres really no \rcomparison  power wise However this \ris a great car for mom to drive to work \rand back and around town  This car is absolutely a great ride  \rFor the price you get everything from \rleather to power  I paid 11000 less \rfor this mustang than my brother did \rfor his G35 Coupe 6MT and the mustang \ris still faster  Great car that Ive had since new Ive \rnever had any problems with anything  \rRegular fluid changes filters and \rlube and shes ready to go Was a daily \rdriver for the first 4 years now a \rgarage queen that only comes out when \rthe weather is nice Fun car to drive  could use a few more horsepower but \roverall a cool fun to drive little \rcarany help on modifications would be \rgreatly appreciated  I was the owner of a 94 Roush Stage III \rMustang until 1999 The new 2004 \rMustang we bought was all the fun and \rexcitment that a Mustang was meant to \rbe  Of course I rated gas milage low \rThe a powerful V8 engine it wasnt made \rfor going far on a little gas I knew \rthat before I drove it home The car is \rfun to drive  That covers it all I am \ra school bus driver and after bouncing \raround in a slow moving bus I feel \ralive again when I get behind the wheel \rof a truly fun car With the satellite \roption in the radio and the Mach 460 \rsound system it has great performance \rfrom a factory stereo as well  So far this car has been very good for \rme It has a lot of style gets very \rgood mileage and everyone who has \rridden in it has been impressed We \rplan to keep it for many years\r  everything was great interior exterior \rhow the car works looks feelsand \rrides it is also really fun to drive  Purchased a GT convertible   Plenty of \rpower to go with the good looks Ride \ris a typical sports car but very strong \rin the corners  The car just jumps \rahead when you put your foot in it  At \r60 it is very enjoyable  This is one of the best cars I have   super car to drive lots of fun on the   The Mustang still hold true to american   Take a test drive and you ll know what   Other than expected chassis flex this \rhas been a zero defect carStandard \rradio6 CD changer is very good even at \rfreeway speeds with the top down Top \rfits much better than my 1986 GT Conv  \rThere is very little tire road inside \rthe cabin  even less than a friends \r2004 Accord  Surprisingly quiet ride \rwith top up  Fuel economy 184 mpg \ris nothing to brag about but then my \rfoot can be very heavy at times At \rleast it uses 89 octane  It is not as \rfast as my WRX but then chicks dig \rit  If this is an example of current \rFord quality then I can recommend it \rwholeheartedly     I am a nearly 60 year old \rgrandmother and my husband just bought \rme this marvelous machine  for our \r41st wedding anniversary And we LUV \rit  Weve had several fun new cars in \rour years but I believe this one is \rthe best yet  Or maybe its because \rwere old and dont remember the real \rmeaning of fun anymore\r  None the less we put 4000 miles on \rit the first month and have NO \rcomplaints  I would recommend it to \reveryone  Especially those who think \rits not an old people car   The car with the six cylinder engine \rhas just the right mix of fun \rsportiness and can fit my family of 4 \rwhen we need to Not to agressive but \rwith all the right tendencies and a \rlittle rumble The dealership I worked \rwith was supurb when it came to setting \rour expectations of the car servicing \rour needs taking the time with us to \rget the right car It took us many \rtrips there to decide  its our third \rcar It was Arlington Heights Ford in \rArlington Heights IL Everyone in the \rfamily is pleased  I waited 22 years for this car  It has   Overall an excellent car I am very \rhappy with my Mustang I love the MACH \r460 Audio System I have put in 2 40 \rseries Flowmasters and believe me it \rwould scare anyone that you come across \rwith at the stop light   I bought this car while in College at \r20000 miles  Served me great with no \rmechanical or driving problems except \rone small pressure cable that helps to \rlift the roof up broke  figures if I \rtake the top up and down like every \rdayThat was the only thing to fix \rMy Car has 120000 miles on it right \rnow and runs like the same day I \rbought it  I would recommend this \rcar to anyone who loves to experience \ra convertible and has a joy for \rdriving  With a few easy modifications adding \rup to 335 hp and 373 gears this GT \ris the fastest quickest fun ride I \rhave ever owned\rTheres nothing better than feeling \rthe wind in my hair while rocking out \rto my favorite tunes in this reliable \rrockship on a perfect springsummer \rday or evening  This is the car I have been saving my \rpennies for this one compares to my \r1973 Convertible for power and comfort\r Love it\r  The Ford Mustang convertible is an\rexcellent car for those seeking a\rconvertible however making a statement\rwith a V8 is not a priority  It still\rkeeps the classic American muscle car\rfeel without costing customers money for\ra more powerful engine  A good buy for\rthose not willing to drive a more\rcompact and in my opinion inferior\rlooking convertible  The car is absolutely awesome it has \rpower and stamina cant touch it  I love my car it drives great the \rradio is awesome and I love the \rcompetition orange color  This is my third Mustang and I love it  fun to drive \rand comfortable  Peppy and Reliable  The last one \rhad more than 140000 miles with only one clutch \rand one set of brakes  Fun as hell to drive I have a \rbeautiful Red Metal Flake paint job \rwith white roof and white leather \rinterior Also have the Mach 1000 sound \rsystem I get compliments \rconstantly wow nice car  this is the BEST car u can buy its   If You want a real MUSCLE CAR the \rMustang GT is the way to go There is \rno pussyfooting around in this beast\rPut be prepared to drive This is no \rV6 passanger style The GT has a rugged \rsuspention so as to feel the road and \rthe power that the car holds Its \rBullish apearance mimics the muscle \rbeneath the hood Old fasion power when \ryou hit the excelorater and a new tight \rhandling that reins far above the \rsquirrly handling of the V6 Do not try \rto compare the beast to the puppy They \rare not in the same class Piorities \rfor purchasing are Looking HOT \rDriving like you mean it and simple \rquality at its finest And the sound \rsystem Rocks  Car is a blast to drive tons of power \rand great handling with a few \rimprovements car turns heads Never \rhad a mechanical problem  i have always dreamt about getting a \rmustang since i was nine and it has \rfinally happened a beautiful black \rmustang gt convertible all mine a \rdream come true I have loved every \rminute inside this car i cannot get \renought of it i will own this car till \rthe day i die i will never buy another \rcar and if i do it would be another \rford There is no car on the road that \ris like the mustang it is a car that \rwomen and men alike love and respect \rand there is so many things you can do \rto it to make it your own i love this \rcar sure the interior isnt upscale \rbut its not meant to be and it serves \rits purpose  fast good looking comfortable and \rthe only surviving american muscle \rcarwhat else can you say  Absolutely love this car  So much fun   I have owned mine for 6 months and am   At age 62 I told my wife I wanted one  The tires shine the dealership used \rstained my white car so parts of it had \rto be repainted  The clockcd unit had \rto be replaced because the clock lost \rmin 10 minutes per wk  But my Tang \ris a beauty and lots of fun to drive \rGet 21 mpg on local drives and 26mpg on \rtrips  It is my Bopping Baby  Love it  Ive always been a Mustang lover so   As a single affluient American male of \rthe Babyboomergeneration  I choose \rto reward myself with an occasional \rgift The gift that I gave myself was \rthe Ford Mustang with all of the bells \rand whistles available Monday through \rfriday I will break out the S Jag \rthe last word in motoring but on \rweekends when fun is the goal it is \rthe Mustang that I choose The car is a \rjoy to drive  I have had my car for a year  still \rlove driving it every chance I get  I \rwouldnt trade it for any other ragtop \rout there  The ride is a little choppy \rat times but that adds to the sports \rcar feel  It gets great gas mileage on \rthe highway for a V8 2324 much \rbetter than around town 1618 so of \rcourse I take it out on the highway any \rchance I get  It looks great  draws \rattention everywhere it goes  Who \rcant resist a bright red Mustang \rragtop  this is a really god car for me because   Its the pony with the 40th Anniv \rpackage 6cyl moves like an 8cyl nice \rcarnice colornice ride Its a sports \rcar The only Ford I would ever buy \rand Chevy had only the corvette The \rSebrings I test drove you could feel \rthe engine struggle it was sad Dont \rneed the power or special needs of an \r8cyl That happens to be the only \rkinds of cars I would up with Now I \ruse Reg unleaded and I cruise    Love the convertable Easy to use Wind \rnoise is noticable but not bad for a \rconvertable No problems so far with \rthe car about 38000 miles on it Gas \rmileage is ok  24 milesgallon on \raverage  We LOVE it  We are no kids  in fact \rwe are 60ish We bought the car on a \rwhim and after 7000 miles in less \rthan two months we are having a ball \rwith it It is soooo much fun to drive  Have been very happy with the car so   I had love mustangsince I was \rsixteenthat when I saw my first \rmustang I do injoy driving my 2004 \rV8GT mustang but I am dispointed in  \rinterior its cheap I was also over \rprice for this car  I paid for my 2004 \rford mustang  32000  I found \raniversary package was nothing to brag \rabout I still looking for the deluxe \rin 2004 anniversary package  fun to drive fun to own turns   This car looks good feels good and is \ra blast to drive  I get comments from \rstrangers about what a sharp car I \rdrive whenever were out cruising with \rthe top down   This is an awesome fun car  Ive loved Mustangs since I was a kid \rLoved the first Mach 1s and already \rown a 98 coupe  My husband recently \rbought me a 04 convertible and I love \rthis car  The exterior design is \rclassy and the interior is plush I \rhave to say the under carriage is a bit \rstiff and creaks on bumpy roads but \rout on the open road it handles very \rwell     ITS A GREAT RIDE IF YOURE LOOKING TO   Even though the platform is old Ford \rkept the car current  Mustang is and \ralways will be more than a car  It is \ran icon to a lifestyle that Americans \rboth young and old still want to hold \ron to  Long live the pony car  Ive been looking at the GT Convertible \rfor some time  Just got out of a 4 \rcylinder Honda  What a difference  \rThis car rocks I have the torch red \rwith black top and black interior GA \rDawg fan with the car to match Power \rto burn handling is amazing  This is a \rtrue American Muscle Machine  I bought \rmine with 1400 miles so got the deal \rof the century  Lucky to be 40 and get \rthe 40th anniversary pony car  Nothing \rrivals it  Take the Ford Mustang GT but add some   6 cyl is underpowered for this   I have had my convertible for over a \ryear now and have had absolutely no \rproblems  It is just an automatic v6 \rmustang but it is still fun and \rcomfortable to drive  All of the \rproblems that I have heard of from \rpeople who have owned convertibles are \rnonexistent  I have had no problems \rwith leaks tears or cuts  Being in \rcollege I was also looking for a \rdependable car that would have no \rproblems with trips home  I put \rhigher performance touring tires on it \rand it drives much better  Although this car did need a new \rtransmission just before the warranty \rexpired it has been troublefree \rsince   My ford mustang was purchased preowned   I love my convertible My kids 4 and \r5 love it too  There is nothing like \rcruising down the road with your top \rdown and enjoying life I have ridden \rin other convertibles Sebring and \ryuck I wouldnt trade my Mustang for \rone It is comfortable fun reliable \rand most of all a conversation piece \rwherever I go  Especially in East \rTennessee where I live  My car is an \rElectric Green color and Cleopatra my \rcar gets eyeballed coming and going \rSo anyone that is thinking about \rgetting a Mustang I would definitely \rencourage getting a convertible They \rare too much fun  I am a tall person and most of the   Probably the poorest engineered  and \rpoorest quality vehicle Ive ever \rowned its my 10th vehicle  Ive had \rnothing but problems since I bought the \rcar I actually got it in July 2002 \rIm glad the dealer decided to sneak a \rpremium extended warranty in on the \rcontract I have a feeling a lot more \rwill go wrong after the initial 36000 \rmiles  Was at the dealership to buy a Focus  \rOut on the lot they had parked all of \rthe Foci next to a Redfire color \rMustang convertible 40th anniversary \rspecial  It said buy me to me  \rEither that or the saleman had super \rtelepathic powers  Dealer must have \rseen me coming  I couldnt resist  \rReally great car to drive  Want to \rkeep it forever  I was excited to finally drive a Mustang that is why \rI decided to rent one for a few days The 6 cyl \rengine with the automatic tranmission is \runderpowered This car is slow and feels heavy The \rinterior build quality seems very cheap The plastic \rholding the window buttons on the drivers side \rdoor is already loose at 14K miles I am 62 and \rthe height of the interior seems OK The seats are \ralright as well The 6 disc changer stereo sounds \rgood I have not tried to remove the top because it \rseemed complicated This might be an OK car but I \rwould expect much more from a Mustang in terms \rof performance even if this is an automatic one  best car I have ever seen  This is my 2nd mustang my first was a \r1965 red pony which my brother and I \rdrove into the ground This one will be \rbetter cherished\rIm short 5 and can comfortably drive \rthis car I love the way it handles and \rthe auto top is the bomb  I can reach \reverything  I bought the laser red GT Convertible new in 1998 for my wifes 49th birthday  Its just had its 30K dealer service and only 3 minor items showed up The rear brake pads and the original battery are nearing replacement and there is slight oil seepage at the steering rack not enough to even spot my garage floor though Other than replacing the original tires at 22K miles and normal maintenance I have spent 0 on repairs Its been trouble free and burns no oil between 3K mile changes It has all factory options except the engine block heater and they all still work fine too I gave the interior a 7 only because legroom is a bit cramped for tall drivers and the seat belt frays  The heritage lives on What a wonderful\rAmerican sports car that combines\raffordabilty with performance The GT\rachieves a 060 time in 56 seconds and\rdoes with style The premium package is\ra bargain to add to the GT car If\ryoure in the market for a fun to drive\rreliable and affordable muscle car this\ris your ride  I love this car  My whole family is jealous  My mom who drives a Porshe Boxter is always asking if she can drive it  It has good horsepower Fun to drive  This is the best Mustang I have driven  This car is great  It handles very \rgood passing gear is really great \rsterio is fantastic it is an eye \rcatcher on the road cruises without \rany effort everything about this car \ris what I expected Only thing I see \rwrong is that now that I have mine is \rthat I see a lot of others ones on the \rroad now  Frustrated owner of a new 2004 with only \r1400 miles  The first 300 the car \rstarted leaking oil  They supposely \rfixed this then went on a road trip around \r350 miles oil leaked again  Found out \rthat there are 181 cars out there that \rhave this problem  Ford will not take \rback the car which I want them to do  \rDealer is ok but certain higher ups \rwere rude to meWATCH OUT  I was looking for a ragtop as my second car and I found an 03 with 3500 miles on it  Ive had the car for two months and what a kick in the pants to drive  It has a great sound system Mach 1000 upgraded wheels more than enough power handles tight I could go on an on Im just kicking myself for waiting this long to buy a pony car  I purchased this 01 Mustang with 44K miles already logged  Mileage is now 68K with only one tune up and a change of disk brakes pads  Very reliable averages 23mpg all the time  Convertible top is very easy to operate  Great fun economical car  Looks fast sitting still   Ive owned my 1999 convertible Mustang for 5 years with only 1 problem I had a problem shortly after I bought it with one of the convertible top hydraulics going out The car was used with 17000 miles on it before I got it and apparently someone tried taking the top down with it still latched into the windshield and this caused the failure Other than that I have had no mechanical problems with this car and it is used as a daily driver The Mustang is a little bumpy because of the sports suspension and height from the ground but thats what you come to expect in a performance RWD car Dont expect to be riding like a Caddy in this bad boy but youll ride in style  This car is a head turner because of the looks the sound and the power Ford has done an incredible job of keeping the Mustang at the forefront of motor vehicle desirability Fun to drive affordable attractive Very nice package  Forty years ago I wanted a Mustang convertible  But after the late 60s I didnt like the body style  When it changed in 1995 I was determined once again to own one  This is probably the most FUN car Ive ever owned and its classic lines really get the looks  The interior couldve used more thoughtful designing and the gas mileage isnt the greatest even with a sixcylinder automatic not my first choice but I bought it used I love driving it and plan to do so for awhile yetuntil I can afford the retro 2005  This car is so much fun to drive especially with the top down  Everyone agrees its a great looking car My first car was a 67 Mustang and I always vowed I get another one day The incentives in December were too good to pass up on so I opted to buy then instead of waiting for the 2005s to come out I am not unhappy with my decision at all  After searching out what I thought would be a great car I found a car that is not so great I am 64 and the interior for me is horrible The seats are angled weird My knee hit the turn signal all the time Why is it so low Poor design inside I enjoy the look of the exterior which is what caught my eye to begin with But it is not the car I was thinking it would be A let down Fast and good looking yes but a lot of money for just a plastic FORD Very cheaply made and little to no quality put into it I had a 300z before this and I am going back to the Z Day and Night Rent one first before buying a Mustang I should have  I have driven a lot of cars and have had many many new cars and this is the best of them all I have to say I sold a 1972 Pantera to buy one of these guys This Mustang will run circles around the Pantera Ford is on the right track with this pony I say drive it first and you will be sold Be sure to buy it loaded and the V8  This car amazes me Its just a v6 but seems to have plenty of powerThe same 6 as the Explorer traded in on it Such a difference Im amazed at the looks I get just driving around Makes it well worth the price It drives and handles very well for a nonperformance version Although it did snow the second day I had it and I had to remember how to drive with RWD been a long time since I did that But after a couple of miles it all came back to me I guess thats the advantage of being over 50 Overall its a very solid car no back seat room to speak of but then again I wasnt looking for any  I love this car  It is the best and most fun car I have ever owned  Its eye catching fun to drive and makes me feel good whenever I get in it  especially when I can get out there with the top down and the music blaring  Its not possible to be mad sad or in a bad mood when you are in this car  I got it in Torch Red with a Parchment top  absolutely perfect  I got my convertible 2 months ago and I love it Its so much fun to drive around and I cant go anywhere without someone commenting on the car Theres really no other car like it  I was looking for a convertible and test drove the 40th Anniversary in December to take it off my list because I was sure it was going to be too small Once I got in it I knew it was mine  It is fun to drive and fun to own  I could never have imagined how many heads this vehicle has turned Though it is a convertible it is really quiet inside with loads of muscle when I need it Ford got this one RIGHT  I love my car Its so much fun to drive around everyone stares The is also no wind noise when the top is up  It drives great on rainy days and has tight steering and great turning radius  Its great  A real sports car at a real price nothing more needed for street driving Very powerful car and handles excellent Ttraction control is a great option as well although I have the automatic transmission version of this ca ItÂ’s a real fun drive and has been a very reliable car  I have owned a 1965 and a 1969 Mustang but this car is a whole new experience Havent had so much fun and enjoyment in 30 years Ford has really done a magnificent job with this PONY The V6 I purchased has everything the GT has except fog lampsdual exhaust a V8 and 17 inch tires  My wife was thinking of getting a new car I surprised her with a new Mustang I was gonna buy a coupe but my dealer gave me a great deal on a convertible As there are still so few convertibles available we were lucky to get one and are we glad we did Its screaming yellow just like all the print ads I added the GT grill and fog lights and the car is a real head turner We love it The car is a blast to drive and the V6 has plenty of power No need for a GT This is the best Mustang to date  This car is a beauty in all ways  The style the handling the interior and the sporty exterior  We ordered our 05 V6 convertible exactly the way we wanted it with all the bells and whistles It took 2 months to get here but it was well worth the wait  My husband and I are both enjoying this car like no other we have every had  We ride with the top down everyday and we live in AZ we may be hot but at least were styling and loving it  My first convertible Coming from an SUV I worried about driving a car  This is fun fun fun Love the retro look inside and out Although I downsized it is roomier than expected  I can pack up for the beach in no time Good pick up glides through traffic even in the rain  I saw the new Mustang and it was MUST HAVE IT  I have no disappointment at all  The features are easy to use the drive is FUN FUN FUN  The LX 6 cylinder 40 convertible is great  Ride is smooth even when you hit some bumps   Talked with some people who have the GT and their only complaint is the gas mileage   If you have never owned a Mustang this is my first one dont hesitate  GET IT  First of all the car is beautiful  It has a wonderful retro look to it and yet is styled for the modern consumer  The legend lime paint is a beautiful color and blends perfectly with the parchment interior and top The leather seating is very comfortableYou are able to retract and replace the top with minimal effort I was also surprised with the trunk room  It appeared to be small but when I put in my files and bag for work I was surprised to see I still had room for much more in the trunk The driving power was a pleasant surprise for a V6 and the ability to turn so tightly with such stability is incredible I am very happy with my purchase   This car has consistently ruled for 40 years and it will continue to rule in my opinion  My dream is one day to own the original Bullitt mustang  I think I know the car well as in my lifetime I have owned 13 different Mustang models from the tiny Mustang 2 all the way to a 93 Cobra  This car has never ever failed me and as long as I live there will be a Mustang parked in my garage ready to run  Waited 6 weeks after ordering for delivery V6 Premium convertible White with Parchment top and parchment leather interior upgrade package 5 speed auto antilock brakestraction control exterior sport appearance package Even nonFord fans cant help but take a second look and make positive comments Neighborhood kids coming by to take a look Power and shift ranges seems just about right for a v6 After careful examination cant find any flaws with paint or fit of exterior parts Still playing with the My Color dash light feature cant decide on color I like bestTop is getting easier to lock down after raising it as it stretches Less than expected road noise with top up  The Mustang GT drives great and looks fantastic It has very comfortable seats and is a pleasure to cruise in on the highway I think its ultimate handling abilities exceed my willingness to explore them but when pushed through the twisties this car would probably put certain 2 seater sports cars to shame With the 5 speed manual the acceleration is outstanding and the incredible exhaust note under power makes the car a total blast to drive Another thing I have noticed over the 4 months I have owned this car is that almost everyone who sees it rides in it or drives it wants one too My wife loves the car too and we are extremely pleased with our purchase our first Mustang by the way  My husband says I have an unnatural emotional attachment to this car A rearwheeldrive convertible is not the most practical vehicle for Montana but I dont care I am in love with this car Im having my midlife crisis early while I can still enjoy it This car is an absolute BLAST to drive top up or top down I have always wanted a red Mustang convertible my grandpa had a 64 12 baby blue Mustang coupe and never thought I would be able to afford one Not only is this car gorgeous but its AFFORDABLE This car is a future classic  I still own my first car after driving it for 32 years  My Dad bought a 66 Thunderbird Convertible for my Mom in late 65  It is still my favorite of my 12 cars  For the first time since I got the Tbird at 16 years old I am in love with my car again  Highly recommended the car has proven to be pure fun  I traded up from a 1994 Mustang 50 What a drastic difference in performance comfort and styling Every day I catch people staring at my vehicle The Shaker 1000 stereo system sounds better than my home stereo  The vehicle is everything Ford designers intended it to be This automobile is sleek in every aspect the exterior and the old body design to the sporty look not so much the European look on the interior  Excellent exterior design Windveil blue is the coolest color Gets up and goes with great handling Shaker 500 CD system is awesome although loading the CDs into the 6 CD changer is confusing and slow Only beef on interior is central column kind of hits against my right leg Mine doesnt have MyColor or trip computer    Have had other convertibles in the past  this one is by far THE most fun to drive  Exterior is stylish with that retro feel  Interior is more comfortable than I expected unless you are in the rear seat Car is surprisingly quiet even when driving with the top and all windows down  you can actually hold a normal conversation  Engine is strong and transmission is smooth  5 speed automatic  While cruising the engine is pretty quiet  when you step on the gas youll hear that throaty rumble that lets you know whats under the hood  This car really is a blast to drive  This is the first new Mustang I have ever owned and it is GREAT  I have an 89 LX convertible that I have owned since 89 and have had a 65 Mustang This car is faster tighter better made and looks better than any Mustang ever built  Great convertible aero design minor wind   Great performance cool sound east to drive The best one yet Ford did it right this time  This car was my party vehicle throughout my college years I have 145000 miles on it and all I had to do was change the oil My convertible top hydraulics began to leak at 100000 and that is all I had to fix Of course since I take the top down and put it back up a million times when I went out it had to break eventually   I plan on driving this bad boy until 200000 miles and keeping it as my fun vehicle  Waited 3 months but it was well worth the wait I ordered without having driven a GT or a convertible I am thrilled The car is comfortable powerful  looks terrific The exhaust sound is almost worth the price by itself I get stares wherever I go Ford has done a tremendous job on the Mustang at realistic prices  The interior upgrade package does a decent job of minimizing the plastic look  feel of the cockpit although I would have been willing to spend a bit more for a little more luxury inside  a passenger seat with power controls  I have a silver 02 v6 automatic Convertible  which is so much fun to drive But not a lot of get up and go from a stop but has plenty of highway power I should have either got the GT or a 5 speed for to dead stop power  This is a really cool car  Love to drive it  We get a lot of stares  The color is what grabs your attention  It is a cool blue with beige interior  I think Ford would sell more of these if they would target women with the lighter interior color as oppose to the typical black  This baby takes off when needed  It reminds me of my 1981 V6 280Z  Love that car  I think the GT is really a waste of power  Where will you be able to open it up without looking over your shoulders  Between my wife and myself we have ownership experience with close to 40 automobiles  We have owned 2 2005 Mustangs in under 3 months  We traded our silver convertible when we went for the first oil change and were shown a beautiful torch red loaded V6 convertible  The stick handles smoothly The engine has great punch for a 6  The silver was an automatic and was also very pleasing to drive  These autos corner and change lanes with agility  The leather seats of our red are much more comfortable than the cloth with more padding where it counts     I just got my V6 Convertible in June and must admit that I havent been able to keep my hands off the steering wheel since The ride is very stable There is almost no pull through tight turns The rear wheel drive makes the ride smooth on bumpy New England roads and I dont have to worry about spilling my coffee The instrument panel design is great No clutter and easy to read Driving this car is exhilarating and fun I have to get used to thumbs up signals nice car wow and the likes comments and lots of stares from fellow drivers   Negative side is that everyone wants to race you and I am too old for that type of stuff  Customer service is a 2  All this talk about the V8 being so great  well I test drove it and thought it was too masculine and loud for a females taste  In addition I requested to exchange a hood with no spoiler  I love the new design of the Ford Mustang with its smooth lines  without the spoiler and the fog lights gag  gag and gag  This look is the real Mustang  Love the Windveil blue Best idea is to purchase the car with cloth seats and then upgrade leather at dealers cost  only 116300  This is as close to heaven as you can possibly get while on this earth Though I must say that I would have preferred an original Â‘64 12 this car is just as great to own drive and ride in  If you have the means I highly recommend picking one up even if only for a test drive or as a rental car  This car will make even the biggest nerd feel like a star  I have been in love with these cars for as long as I can remember and this car is the only one that I would even consider categorizing as one of my favorite cars beside the original Â‘64 12 red with white wall tires and white leather interior and a white convertible top with all original parts  Mustang handles excellent 6 speed manual engages easily Pick up phenomenal Convertible easy to put up and down Ride is easy and comfortable for a sports car Looks great too  Purchased for my wife and its an amazing vehicle  I own a Hummer and and BMW so this is the summer car and it delivers  Tremendous power awesome interior red w accent and great exterior retro look  It turns heads whereever we go  Nice backseat room in comparison to other years models   I havent been in the Mustang market for years After the 60s and early 70s they seem to have lost their appeal to me anyway  I have the V6 premium fully loaded black with red leather interior The new style brought me back  I am very happy with the purchase  so reasonably priced  Have never had any problems with my 1999 Mustang convertible  I love this car Am considering trading for the 2005 but having a hard time parting with this one  This car is so fun to drive  I had a 2002  Mustang and it cannot compare to the new one  I feel safer the roof is not so close to your head  I absolutely recommend this car with no hesitations  The FORD Mustang GT Convertible is a blast and a treat to enjoy  Even as a 2001 model purchased used online I am pleased with the performance  The only ding would be the fake hood scoop leaks water a good half an hour after a car wash and thus leave water spots on the hood etc  Otherwise let the good times roll  Waited several months to receive delivery on Red Convertible  Everything I expected  Have taken three trips around Colorado over 12000 foot mountain pass into South Dakota and through Wyoming Montana Canada Rockies Washington Oregon and Utah  Handled beautifully Very responsive A solid car corners very well makes driving fun again  I get at least one compliment each time I take it out on the road  I cant decide what I like best about this car  I have had so many people stop and look at the car and just say its beautiful  Then I hop in and drive its a blast it just rips off the line and handles crisply  The seats are comfortable and the wind noise is better than my old Miata  The only disappointment is the Shaker 500 stereo it lacks sophistication and the CD player is very finicky with MP3 discs  The door mounted subwoofers cause the door handles to vibrate and hum when handling low frequencies  Outstanding could not find a better car so I bought it I would do it over again and again A far out automobile  I ordered in December from a dealer that had no allocation Reordered in April finally arrived June Top ripped around window factory just replaced The AC was  better colder in my 2000 No inside glove box truck release Why only 1 rear window switch for both The key rubs your leg should be higher Shaker 1000 not worth the money besides eats trunk space Quiet fast good looking no doubt this car is a classic Even with the faults where could you buy a better car for the money Headlights are great for the back roads Backseat not bad in a pinchThis car stands out in a crowd  This car is a real looker you would swear it had eyes Mine has the roll bar it is killer to look at Then the light turns green pure exhilaration you have to behave because 060 in 57 seconds can get you in deep quick I have ridden in more comfortable cars but admit that if I want comfort I will take my Mark VI This Ford product is tops to drive and own   Ive had my 2003 Ford Mustang Convertible for a couple of months and I am having such fun  When the top is down it turns everyones head It has no fear of increased speed and is a dream to drive in the hills and on long trips to the ocean  Its just perfection  It had an exhaust leak when I purchased it  though it wasnt detected by the dealerships topnotch service team  The local oilchanging place heard it and the dealership had it repaired  Apparently it is a recall or it is just a common problem  Other than that its been the most fun Ive had since I gave up the keys to my minivan LOL  I love my car it is great in the mountains  just pure fun  Bought from CarMax at 18k miles  1k miles later they rebuilt the rear gear box to try to get rid of the moaning sound between 40 and 50 miles an hour on deceleration  Never worked  At 90k the gear box was rebuilt again because of a constant whir Lets see at 70k I got a new front end Tops starting to leak Valves tap a lot if you dont keep cleaning the injectors   Travel 150 miles a day at an average 72 miles an hour  Time to clean injectors again and probably replace the egr valve  My 9th Ford and probably my last if Toyota makes a larger truck  Ive been a Mustang owner 2 weeks now and wow asking myself why I waited so long Jet black V6 premium convertible with upgraded interior black leather black top and exterior sports package Cant forget those side airbags and the active antitheft for the insurance break With the new body style it is a head turner from its shiny black exterior to its trippy old style rims The driving experience is wonderful hard to put into words really but you could judge by the big grin on my face each time I drive it The MPG advertised was accurate I get about 17 city and up to 25 freeway the main difference is I WANT to drive it and I take the long way just so I get to drive it more  At 67 leg room is a must and this Mustang delivers mucho leg room  Getting 30 miles to the gallon  This is a fun car to drive around town It gets decent gas mileage and is reliable I purchased this vehicle new and it has never had a single mechanical problem  This car has given me no trouble whatever  It has taken a lot of abuse from my son and has kept on ticking  Im very impressed with its performance and toughness  For the money its the finest car Ive seen  This car has definitely been fun to drive it handles great and has a lot of power  However I just spent two weeks in a rental because of rust on the panel above my windshield  The seal was faulty and 3 months out of warranty  I dont suggest an aftermarket car starter  My car has issues with starting due to it  Other than that I love it  With the rush to get the new 2005 Mustangs smart buyers bought the 2004 models at tremendous savings The convertibles were well built cars with no leftover kinks from prior years The performance for the 39L 6 cylinder is more than adequate and if you dont constantly floor it the gas mileage is outstanding We were able to obtain 25 mpg combined cityhighway on a 3900 mile vacation Incredible If you are in the market for a used nice looking sports car convertible do not hesitate to buy a LOW mileage adult driven model The price should be right with everyone else wanting the new styles No disappointments and with gas so high you can basically have it all with this model  I have been wanting a Mustang for as long as I can remember  Now I finally have one and its so much more than I imagined  At 61 years old and recently a widower  I asked my children if they thought I was going through a second childhood since I was considering purchasing a new Mustang GT convertible They all said if thats what you want go for it I did I had planned a trip to Las Vegas and decided to extend the trip and drive I made a two week trip covering 5500 miles from Georgia to California averaging 235 mpg and drove over 1000 miles on two different days The weather was great the car performed flawlessly and the ride was very comfortable This car is not the fastest or most expensive on the road but dollar for dollar is a fantastic value and a super performer Im looking forward to the GT500  I love this car  Its fast sporty comfortable and a real head turner Outstanding handling and pick up  With just a few tweaks here and there this car becomes a hybrid muscle car and sports car  Goes FAST sounds AWESOME great handling  like its superglued to the road  The best part about the tweaks  eg aftermarket exhaust  is that they dont compromise reliability or fuel economy The convertible top is very solid and secure when locked up no flapping or significant noisiness even on the highway  Topdown this car is a blast just as well and the MACH sound system can easily be heard over even a passing semi     After leasing Ford Mustangs for 12 years that covered 3 GTs fully equipped  I learned the hard lesson of buying a Ford My last Mustang GT had so many various problems that Ford continued to ignore that my engine blew with 61k miles I have had 2 tune ups oil changes on time a new fuel filter 5 new coils and so on Ford takes no responsibility in their failures and the defective Mustang I am never never going to buy a American car again Not only because it was a horror on wheels but worse  a corporate giant like Ford wanted to rip me off for 7000 dollars to fix again  my mechanic 1000  never again will I be caught in American cars I learned my lesson and they lost a customer forever  My sonic blue 2005 Mustang convertible is the most fun machine Ive ever owned Driving with top down warm wind in my face hairs mostly gone and feeling great as the feelings of youth return I love my Mustang This is the ultimate time machine Put on the Beach Boys or any other hits from the 60s crank up the stereo and wow  2005 Roush GT Sonic Blue Convertible  Having spent much of my late teens and early 20s restoring 67  68 Mustangs I was blown away when I first saw the 2005 retro Mustang Naturally I had to have one and bought myself a birthday present in June 05 I have about 2500 miles on the car and it has been flawless Its great fun to drive and Roush has tweaked the car just right from the exhaust to the ground effects Its spooky but I feel as if Im sitting in my 68 Fastback albeit a greatly improved version With the flood of after market products becoming available by the minute it will no doubt keep me busy again Cant wait to blow the doors off any retro Camaro or Cuda we may yet see  This car is an absolute kick  Ive had several Lincolns TCars  Mark 8s  Sebring convertibles  this car is my true favorite  Its quick  classy and a ton of fun to drive  I cant wait for spring to drop the top  I had it down on day 1  hated to put it up but  I live in Chicago  I love my new 2005 Mustang Convertible I ordered it through Ford and got the options I wanted Ive had the car now 10 months and it rides great Ive not had a bit of trouble with it It is my 2nd car so I only drive it when the weather is good  This car is Mustang through and through I bought this car because it reminded me so much of my 1967 coupe I love the retro styling and the performance fantastic This is not a bells and whistles car If you start comparing it to other midsizes it wont win many categories That being said this is the ultimate ride for muscle car fans and especially for Mustang aficionados  I purchased my convertible after much research between several makes The Mustang offered the best value for the money and even with the six cylinder is pretty fast  Finally finally we have a Mustang  the car we always wanted Bought used in almost perfect condition in and out Drives sweet looks fast  Wish there was a little more power in the standard but that is what the GT model is for New to a convertible but lovin it Stereo sounds awesome came with stock tape radio but put 240 watt Pioneer cd deck in and no need to say more Mustangs hold their value and are reliable and are just a fun ride  I have read everyones reviews about this Mustang and I must say I have had no problems with my car ever  Not only that but the people that I bought it from also had no problems with this car  So Im sorry for those of you who have had bad experiences mostly it was the fact you had a bad dealer but the car itself is amazing fast quick and very comfortable for two people the back seat is kinda small  I test drove many other sport convertibles but liked the ride of the Mustang best I would have picked the Honda 2000 but it is so tiny you better be 135 lbs and 55 The Nissan 350Z was nice but you feel every bump in the road This car is great except the quality of the interior for the price I had an F150 Lariat and the interior quality was far better equal price The leather seats are very nice but at 510 I find my knee resting against the center console The stereo is outstanding for a factory unit but I could tell no difference in the quality between the Shaker 500 and the 1000 even though the 1000 comes with a sub in the trunk  I purchased my first 2005 V6 convertible back in April 2005 when there were very few to be found I believe this dealer took advantage of that fact Anyway it was the Windveil Blue with a black topbeautiful   Always wanted a Mustang convertible I have a Shelby Mustang so performance  fun is important The price  insurance was surprisingly low I lost my company car due to cost containment and never shed a tear with this as my personal replacement for transportation to and from work  Sounds great for a six cylinder  Great pickuppower for a six cylinder  plenty of power  Not too pricey for a sporty car like this  reasonably priced Good buy for the money  Shaker 500 sound system sounds great  Gas mileage  about 20 mpg around town  is satisfactory   Ive had Camaros TransAms a Corvette and Mustangs and this is my favorite so far  I went from an SUV to the Mustang and I thought I would regret the size change but let me just tell you this WHAT A RIDE I have no regrets and think it is the best car I could have ever bought It handles like a true sports car should Want to let your hair down and have a great ride Get a Mustang   I just purchased my new 06 convertible Mustang  All black  This car is amazing  Drives like sports car and the same time feels like you are driving an old Cadillac  I was considering getting the V6 but after driving the V8 with manual transmission I was convinced  that the V8 was my answer for my new toy hands down If youre thinking about getting this car as an extra car for fun driving then I would recommend the manual V8  If you enjoy music and have an extra few dollars then get the Shaker1000   I drive the Mustang very little because I want to keep it really nice  It is redfire with the light parchment interior and top  The quality of the interior is not up to par with the imports but for the price the performance is a bargain  The car reminds me of my 1969 Ford Torino GT which is a good thing  The difference is that the Mustang actually handles well I think the Mustang is a great car for anyone who appreciates American v8 power It feels like the days of old but with refinement\r   We havent had the car long but it looks great and runs like the stallion that it is  The interior is much quieter than I expected based on reviews unless you are in the throttle  I am fitting two kids in the back seat  tight fit but they love cruising with the top down  I bought this car in Sept of 05 and have only put 700 miles on it but what fun miles theyve been Best bang for the buck by far Handling acceleration braking and that infectious eye appeal are just some of the highs youll have while driving this all American beauty  This is a very stable convertible Very still ride not all loose and rubbery like most convertibles and the power is awesome  I ordered this car from the dealer in Redfire Metallic with a white top and white leather interior and a 5speed transmission  It has the chrome Cobra type spoke wheels that really shine  It is a joy to drive and really turns heads    While vacationing in South Beach Miami my wife and I rented a convertible We liked it so much we decided to buy one But let me tell you this Mustang GT is no ordinary convertible This car is much faster and handles better that advertised The interior in our opinion isnt too shabby either We really like the retro styling It is quite similar to the Mustangs of the 60s and 70s That is where the similarities end The ride is unbelievable for a car this price The interior is so quiet for a convertible And we havent been able to detect any cowl shake With the tires provided Pirelli Zero Neros you have to go out of your way to make this thing slide even a little A very nice car  My 03 Yellow Stang GT Convertible was an amazing find With only 3100 miles on it when I bought it in August of 05 I couldnt walk away With the Mach 1000 system built into it the 5 speed the color and being a convertible Im proud to have made the choice of purchasing my first true pony car Handles tight shifts solid loves 2nd gear Would highly recommend to anybody looking for a whole lot of power at a bargain price to check one of these out   I purchased my car private party about 3 years ago In the 3 years of owning it I have come to find a few things These are very tight convertibles well made with a lot of power  They are also one of the quietest on the road with the top up Plenty of power and decent gas mileage around town but can get very good when on the open road driving long distances  Coming from a 50 I was hesitant on a 46 car but made sure I got a 99up with the 265HP Plenty of power to set you straight  My only issue is the coolant sensor light that seems to be a typical issue with the 9900 cars  Get a 5 speed The resale on the automatic cars is poorer  I purchased a 2005 premium Mustang convertible its a steel blue with a black top I love My Color for the different colors you can make the dash It has a 500 watt stereo system in it iI just purchased the pony grille with the fog lamps in it I get so many compliments on the car I am going down Carlisle PA to the Mustang show  Had this car almost 6 years  purchased new  Havent had a single problem Runs like a breeze and everything is original  Body is still very tight and looks great  Mach stereo is awesome and sounds best with the top down  Car is a lot of fun to drive steering is a little heavy especially when trying to parallel park  Engine is fast on the top end slow down low  Can still beat 2006 Acuras and many Porsches Very happy with workmanship  the car looks and drives just as good as the day I bought it without a single squeak  Hope to keep for another 50 years  Always wanted a little pony and what I got was one with a lot of power and a pretty smooth ride for a sports car  It is the most fun to drive and it is definitely a head turner with its top down  I have had more compliments on this car than i had during my 35 years of driving  Ive had the car about a month now and I find it very comfortable inside and easy to drive The stereo is super I love the idea of the changing interior colors on the dash as well as the other features you would expect in a luxury car The exterior is awesome I have yet to take it on a long trip to see the gas mileage highway driving I recommend this car to anyone looking for a sports car  I purchased this car last spring after I was in an accident in my 2000 Mustang coupe  The convertible is a lot more fun of a car to drive around and I have been very happy with the reliability of both of the cars  I love the look and drive of the car as well and recommend the manual transmission and the V6 if you are doing your own maintenance more room in the engine compartment makes it easier to access   Road noise and comfort of the convertible make it much less enjoyable on long road trips  After an hour or two on the highway with the top down your ears will be ringing for hours afterwards   Also you will need excellent tires or more weight in the back to keep traction in rain or snow  I have never been so happy with a vehicle Im a 44 year old former hot rodder who has owned several muscle cars from the 1960s and 70s The 2005 Mustang represents the best of all those cars but on a modern platform that you can drive everyday under full warranty I have nothing but praise for how it looks drives and makes me feel when Im behind the wheel This car rocks with a capital R How Ford managed to combine the retro styling with practical driveability awesome performance and comfort plus head turning good looks while remaining the lowest priced 300HP car out there is pure genius  I picked this car in October of 05 after waiting 45 months for delivery It was worth the wait Ford hit not just a home run but a grand slam Exceptionally powerful and comfortable cruiser The world seems a better place when you are cruising in this future collectible with the top down All of 6569 Mustang styling cues in one package        I waited for Ford to bring back the Mustangs that I loved from the 60s My GT convertible is a great car to drive It has power styling and the car sounds great   Best Mustang ever I love the styling even better than the Shelby GT500 Handling ride and acceleration is outstanding Interior is easy to maintain comfortable and fits the character of the car It avoids the Tokyo by Night over abundance of electronic doodads that distract from a true drivers car  I just bought my car and it is awesome I get many many compliments on the look and it is so much fun driving it   Love my Stang Always drove Ford F150s and decided to downsize what a sweet ride   I have loved and owned Mustangs all my life I have had a 97 and 96 GT convertible Out of all the cars I have driven these were overall very good automobiles Yes they are going to have a few problems They seem to not have very good radiators because they tend to overheat some  Other than that Mustangs have overall been pretty good  Most that have problems with them is because the previous owner has mistreated the car they are mostly well built cars  I have been looking at a convertible mid life thing for a long time  For the price style and funtodrive the Mustang was the one Metallic red parchment top parchment leather seats I wanted a GT but the loaded ponypremium with 500 watt stereo  with the v6 was greatespecially since a GT this loaded was many thousands more and beyond my budget  I love this car and have rarely put the top up in the almost 3 weeks I have owned it Funny how the CDs sound so much better  How does one go through life without driving a convertible  Having had classic cars in the past I wanted something that would last and have excellent parts AND service availably wherever I want to travel  This is a fun car with excellent handling characteristics  It has excellent acceleration and road handling manners  I am impressed  My wife and I have enjoyed this Mustang for the past month since we traded in our 2004 Mustang Has surprising power and response that is enjoyable Lots of heads turn most responses we get is for the color Windviel Blue seems to have everyones attention My wife likes going from our Xtreme Blazer to the Mustang easy transition from one to another but starting out in second in the Chevy cant be done in the Mustang Well at least not for her  I bought it at end of March  Had to contact 17 dealers to get a GT convertiblewith a manual transmission People are always staring and telling me how much they love this car I never thought a car could make you more popular but this car has  It drives great The top is very easy to manage the pickup and speed are great This is truly a great Mustang If you can go for the convertible and V8 My wife and children used to say I was starting to drive like an old man They cant believe how Ive morphed into a speed fanatic I would buy it again it I had it to do over  So far no mechanical problems or bugs to work out Thats about it  Have only driven the car 1000 miles since purchase in March but very satisfied with its overall quality and speed The Mustang is a great sports car buy for the money spent compared to others   The 2006 Mustang must have been built with cost the most important item It has no under hood light foot well lights or daytime running lamps Small items to be sure but should not add to the total cost The five speed transmission does not shift smoothly Was told by the dealership that nothing could be done   The car is fun to drive and very comfortable during distance driving Ive owned it 2 months and still cant get the smile off my face The only negative is the interior The plastic is cheap but the overall car makes up for it The car is a headturner  Big bang for the buck Roomy enough for two and space for luggage Great styling inside and out Constantly get positive comments on redfire color and 20 wheels and tires Great handling and breaking Acceleration is great and lays rubber on command Great rumble from dual exhaustsmay upgrade to Ford racing exhaust Worth every penny of 31000 price tag  I always take the long way to work  That sums up my experience with the car There has only been one problem in over a year of ownership and that was the top Ford fixed it under the EXTENDED warranty Really surprised me and was much appreciated considering what Ive heard from others about Ford  Awesome looks sounds great faster than 99 of cars on the road been super reliable 281 cubes and American muscle My former Acura was nothing in performance and reliability compared to this Goes to show if you treat a car right and maintain it properly itll love you back People gripe about the fake scoops but look at 6070s muscle cars and tons have fake scoops too I love em  I love my pony I ordered a Windveil blue convertible with parchment top and leather interior same color with comfort package new for 2007 Also added an interior upgrade I wanted to brighten up the inside as much as possible not a big fan of black but the black that is there looks great Oh Pony package of course This car is awesome She gets looks everywhere she goes So much fun with the top down My salesman said to order the boot that goes over the top when its down It helps keep it clean when the top is down for an extended period of time  Its also expensive to add the hardware for it to the car if you decide you want it later  If you have cats invest in a car cover  Have waited a long time to find a ragtop which was not driven into the ground by a youthful driver If you are lucky enough to find one as I did adult owned by only 2 owners it is a GREAT car to drive and performance is very good  This is a great car to cruise in to commute in and to have fun being bad in  The power and the sound of the throaty exhaust will always put a smile on your face  Therapists should have very little business from owners of this vehicle  It looks great handles surprisingly well and has power to spare  My only regret is that I did not buy this car a year ago  I have owned my 2002 Mustang GT Convertible now for about 18 months It consistently outperforms the hottest of import sports cars even those advertising 3040 more horsepower Gas mileage is a pleasant surprise 1820 in town 2527 on the highway The car is not really tightly built but it holds up well even under hard use The sum total of the pieces add up to a car that is quick fast exciting and fun to drive and turns heads wherever it goes I could not have done better with my money  I have owned many Mustangs from a 66GT 85GT 93LX 99GT and a 91 GT that I traded on this car This is far and away a better designed and assembled car The automatic transmission in this car is the best shifting overdrive Ford transmission yet It accelerates and shifts very fast for a stock car yet is smooth when driving normally The power top is quiet and goes up and down quickly The controls are laid out well and everything is within the drivers reach The stereo is the Shaker and sounds okay speaker placement is difficult in a convertible but could be improved with the upgrade to the 1000 The fit and finish is the best Ive seen from Ford No matter where you go people stare  The car drives like a big heavy American car Nostalgia like a Moms car but is hot and sharp at the same time  It feels very safe and is exciting the way it holds the road and has pick up like most V8s  The dash could be a little more Mercedesish but I like the chrome and design  Great speakers and upgraded music system  Pretty bad on fuel economy  One hot car 5th  gear is only used after 60  It is amazing that at 80 it is turning just 2000 rpm  No joke  I took a trip at 60 to 70 mph and got 228 mpg Most times I get right around 19 to 20 mpg  It is very difficult to find information about this car  How many were manufactured  HPWEIGHT ratio How much are the commemorative medallions valued at  I have six of them  I have special wheels bought from a noted tire dealer  I have been offered 250 or more for the original alloy rims  Why are they worth anything at all  3 people have offered me at least that much money  I used to own a classic Mustang convertible  This car is just like it except this car has better steering no dead spot in the steering doesnt shake going over bumps has a great radio top doesnt leak cowl doesnt leak no more wet carpet windows dont rattle and yes the gauges all work  All in all this car has all the great styling I remember with none of the bad things I had tried to forget  while i do not drive my mustang far when i do dirve it it gets stares and it is exciting to get on the gas   When I first test drove this car I was truly amazed at the way it performed  I had been driving SUVs for many years and the thought of a rearwheel drive car was unrealistic  It handles extremely well its sharp looking Im always getting compliments on it and it truly is fun to drive I am completely sold  This V6 is surprisingly fast I am sorry its not the GT but price was prohibitive Mainly use this on weekends when top down driving is the most fun I like the fact that the V6 exhaust has a pleasant sound although Im told switching to the right side GT muffler will improve the sound Wont sound like a V8 but a more throaty sound none the less Im considering it but my selling dealer says a different muffler could void the engine warranty I dont buy that but Im afraid to take the chance Maybe after the warranty expires  I have driven the mustang GT for 4 months It is an absolute blast to drive The fuel economy is not as well as I had hoped  I bought a 2005 Premium Convertible  My first car Ive bought on my own  So far Ive had it in twice for the fuel pump and Im taking it in to get the top replaced because the rear defroster stopped working  Ive had the gear shifter replaced in it  Im not happy camper with this car  If it wasnt for all these problems Id absolutely love this car  Rides great minus the time it stopped running on the middle of I95  Love driving with the top down love the audio in it  Maybe I just got a bad pony  But I wont ever buy a Ford again the service is awful  Ive owned this car for just over 3 months and have had nothing but problems The car has been out of service for almost 40 days Just got the car back from the dealer on Friday they had it for 26 consecutive days and cant fix a clickingpopping sound in the front end Called Ford technical service and are sending a tech in on 110106 to look at the car The headliner is falling out now held in place with cardboard shims rear axle bearings and seals replaced front and rear rotors already turned rear quarter windows replaced because of rusty screws holding the weather strips parking break lever replaced finish coming of the chrome ac vent rocker moldings loose and the list goes on  My mother has a 6 banger 04 My 06 pony package is far superior in every category not taking into account fuel Yeah I have a lead foot With a GT I would be in jail as speeding is way too easy with the Pony  The handling is nice for such a heavy car but for the money you cant beat it  Be ready for some road noise but get the Shaker sound system and youll never notice it  Ive only put 5000 miles on it but havent had a single problem other than the frequent compliments     I have never spoken with more strangers or had more people talk cars with me than when I started driving this 05 Mustang GT convertible last year  It has called for so much attention because of its incredible beauty It has awesome power and iI never fear pulling out at intersections anymore because NOW I KNOW I can make the turn without getting in someones way I GO  She goes  Entering and exiting military posts has guards drooling over this gorgeous retro Stang  With the top down folks pull up beside me and start chatting about it I just wish I had bought this earlier in the year to enjoy it longer  I enjoy driving the Mustang except for a whining noise from the manual transmission in 5th gear and pulling positive torque  No noise when not under acceleration or slowing down  This is my third Mustang and the previous 88 and 95 both with the 5 speed manual did not make any noise like this  The dealership mechanic and the owner of the dealership both drove the car and both acknowledge the noisy gear whine but Ford wants more info from them comparing the noise with another new 5 speed manual transmission in another car  This transmission was flawed right from the first mile and should have been immediately repaired or replaced  Needless to say I am very disappointed with Ford and their quality  What a great raw muscle car Fast throaty acceleration  Easy to use controls  Drawbacks are the lumbar or lack of support and the slight interior noise from the mini window on the drivers side    I bought my 07 last July  It is the best car I have ever owned  It has superb handling great accelerationa terrific rumble from its V8 and twin pipes wonderful stability at even VERY high speeds and one of the best enginetransmission combos I have seen in any car domestic or imported  and its got that great retro Mustang look  If American car makers would build all their cars as they have this one the imports would be in full retreat  I bought it for my wife and havent let her touch it  This car has been an absolute dream to own and drive  For a woman who has always loved Mustangs this is possibly a perfect match  The handling is great for cruising it really hugs the curves  All 300 horses given the room to run performs wonderfully  For people who love to listen to tunes the system cant be beat  Once owned 68 Firebird convertible and recently turned 40 and couldnt resist This is a nice and fun reproduction of the original I bought the Pony Package V6 convertible in Windveil Blue and am very happy with it A good value vehicle for the money  Bought the Mustang for looks and performance Not disappointed with handling acceleration and oh the sound My only two complaintsthe seat belt receiver is hard to reach and the interior easily scratches  This car is the most exciting fun vehicle I have ever owned  It turns heads with its styling and not only performs well off the line and accelerating at higher speeds as well as taking off ramps but also with the fantastic sound system  Ive always wanted a retro style Mustang and now that Ive got it I couldnt be happier  Excellent handling and enough power in the V6 that you dont need to drop the extra for the V8  Seat belts are tight but that adds to the sports carpower feel  I have people stop me almost every day to compliment my car Wouldnt have gotten it without the Pony package  Just adds exactly what is needed to make this one incredible machine  As I am fast approaching my 60th birthday it is nowhere near as fast as the 49 seconds it takes this Mustang GT to reach 60  Telling ya I have been driving Ford trucks and SUVs for over thirty years and finally I bought a vehicle for the pure fun of driving it When you crank it up the first thing you sense is a low rumbling growl generated from a 300HP OHC engine  By the time you put it into 4th gear you are going 70MPH at 2000 RPM  Thats power  Add a little Rolling Stones on the Shaker 500 sound system and life takes on a whole new glow      For what is really an inexpensive car I have had more fun driving daily than any other vehicle I have ever owned  The level of performance that is available right off the showroom floor for 30k cannot even be contemplated by any other car  Throw in the fact that Ford understands and embraces the aftermarket phenomenon for Mustangs and that the car is built for addons and it can be a fun hobby  Spend an extra 10k in upgrades and you have a car that challenges Porches and blows away Corvettes  Great job on this one Ford now work on the rest of your line  On a warm summer day top down music blasting yet you can still hear the rumble of the V8 engine  When you put your foot into the throttle it jumps like a thoroughbred race horse  Theres nothing like cruising with the top down  Be sure to tell your wife to adjust the seat so she can depress the clutch all the way to floor for each shift and for starting car Frantic call 1 Car wont start  Frantic call 2 Rear windows are down and I do not know how to make them go up Frantic call 3 overhead light wont go off and rear windows are down again Explained the lights will go off automatically after you exit the door and showed her the little buttons to turn offon individual lights Also explained button that makes top go up and down and if pushed will make rear windows go down Why didnt I tell her before I had to sell the 5 speed and thought the AC and rear defrost and electric seats was a success  All my life I wanted a Mustang and Im glad I waited till now to buy it The mix of the old body style in and out sold me on this model Handles like a sports car should road hugging smooth that pulls threw any curve Power is more than enough there may be faster but I dont see people breaking their necks to look at the grandma styled competitors Going top down is an experience everyone should have From 6 to 6o year olds Ive had them all point and compliments abound   This car is junk  The quality of this vehicle is so substandard that they left a 3 unsealed seam that lets water in causing electrical system failures and the car to become such a mildewed mold covered stinking mess that Ford dealers wont even take the car as trade in Not an isolated incident Search 20052007 MUSTANG LEAKS and watch what you find  Ford finds this kind of defect acceptable They will patch it and send you on your way regardless of any other damage that might have occurred If you anticipate customer service and any assistance from Ford dont hold your breath  These cars come with a taillight warranty when they cant see your taillights your warranty is over  What a great car Tons of speed a roomy interior great sound system and good mileage  The convertible top is a cinch to operate And the car is a real headturner Expect to get a lot of attention when youre driving one of these   I will be 70 in March and my wife of 46 years will be 6939 in September 2007  My wifes friends at Curves Gym drive convertibles and we had a GT PT Cruiser that was boring us to death So we went looking for something to make us feel younger and have something we can have for years to come 5 speed 300hp  The car is a 10 Mileage beats our Cruiser in city and highway  GO FOR IT  Went from an 04 GT to an 07 GT convertible The difference is amazing Ride performance and comfort are much improved I dont want to get out  I am a FordLincoln Mercury Tech for 38 years I have owned three Lincoln Mercury MKVIII s and compared to this Mustang Ford missed the mark  The handling is not near as good compared to the MKVIII I have taken curves on a every day basis at high speeds and the Mustang will feel loose in the rear end This is due to the live axle The Mustang is a fun car and quick but would have better handling with an independent suspension But all in all this is a very fun car to drive for a 58 year old young man Note  the Mustang will pass just about everything except a GAS STATION   In 2 weeks the honeymoon is not over Just starting the engine lets you know this car rocks Distinctive sound is like Barry White  deep vibrant and powerful Performance with 18 tires is superb Five speed shifting is smooth and solid Front seats are extremely comfortable and supportive Not a squeak or rattle  very tight Couldnt find a defect on delivery The gauge display is pure retro but the color options are an up to date touch Driving has never been this much fun  I have had many muscle car convertibles in the past and didnt realize how much I missed them until I took the Mustang for a test drive The old cars especially with the prices they are currently demanding dont have anything on this car The ride handling and performance are awesome and I wouldnt even think twice before making a cross country trip with this car Unfortunately I live in the great white north so my baby is put away for the winter But since I put it away I have been busy installing the Ford Racing power pack cant wait to drive it with the 325hp I will have in Spring  I have always bought Fords but this one is junk I garage and care for my car Serviced only through Ford I do not beat on this thing and for some unknown reason 1 The battery dies 2 Car decides to stop running 3 Brakes lock up My next car is a Toyota If Ford goes belly up after 5 years they brought it on themselves  I had always wanted a GT so when they were running some rebates I went for it  No regrets since The only problem Ive had with it is a nut coming loose on one of the top drive cylinders which I was able to fix myself  I cant get enough of the power and sound even in stock form  After leaving it with my Dad for a year while I was overseas I wasnt out of the driveway before I said to myself This is a fast car  I also think its better looking than the new one but thats just me  Its no wonder Chevy couldnt sell Camaros the Mustang is just about perfect  No frills just fun    Ive had this car for 2 years and its amazing  Its everything youd expect from 6 cylinders and a little more  And it turns heads everywhere I go    The car reminds me of a Porsche I owned Most stable performance from a convertible no less I like the long throw shift better on this car than a 2007   Well my mom got this Mustang in 03 for a real good deal Its one of a kind black w white top and white leather Now I drive it mostly and I have to say it is fun It is quite poor at low rps however when its up there its really up there Had tranny problems and power widow control sank into door Fog lights are constant problem Back seat is nonexistent and front is uncomfortable Stereo is awesome though other than above mentioned problems this car seems quite reliable  Startup sound makes you swoon Exterior styling is perfect Interior comfort front seats only is impeccable Performance is fabulous As you can tell this car is all about emotion  I drove it to Florida in late November with plans to stop halfway for the night But the car was so much fun to drive that I kept going Twenty hours later I reached my destination and still wanted to keep driving  Of the 51 vehicles that have passed through my hands in the last thirtyfive years this is the most enjoyable  Note With only 8300 miles and being stored during the winter I cannot truthfully report on longerterm reliability  Had a GT 20 years ago was fun to drive then even more fun now Convertibles are a blast like riding a motorcycle but more comfortable the V8 power is awesome can easily spin the tires Seats and position are comfortable back seat is fine for kids only Handles quick a little light in the rear though The tops wear out and run 400800 Real fun to drive turns heads Plenty of power  Fun like it was 30 years ago Fast reliable Much better handling Ride is stiff for old joints  This car has been so wonderful to drive I bought the car with 34k miles It now has over 120k and still runs great The only major expense has been to replace the top  I would recommend this car to anyone  First off I overpaid for the car by about 23k Which wouldnt be a problem because I love the design of the car and the constant attention it gets But the car loses value at an unacceptable rate Its honestly sickening its been sitting in my garage for 4 months and its lost over 2k in value   Ive had my stang for about a year Living in the north east its garaged for the winter but spring is only a month away  I cant wait to park my Jeep and get back out in my Mustang   Its taken 12 years but I finally got another Mustang  I enjoy everything about this car the feel of driving it shifting everything  Ford did an amazing job at building this car but there are some drawbacks but those were to keep the cost down  The best yet for Mustangs Beautiful and powerful Much improved  seating and noise Unbelievable Shaker 1000  I bought this Mustang in Feb of 2004 with only 52000 miles on it  It already had the 60000 miles work done on it  Since then Ive driven it to about 88000 miles   It performs great  good acceleration and decent cornering though I rarely push either  The top very rarely leaks only when Ive driven in BIG storms  Its only happened twice  This is a big improvement over my last convertible a 92 Mustang  The only problems Ive had are that the cruise control button fell off one day last year its still usable and the front brakes have needed A LOT of work 1300  They always cover the front rims with brake dust as well  Overall Im very happy with the car  I wasnt looking for a Mustang and have never been a big fan I saw this 7 year old vehicle with less than 55k miles while looking at other convertibles I gave it a try because of the low price and was really impressed I actually liked the handling better than Mustang GT convertibles Id driven I was surprised by how powerful the V6 felt with the 5 speed manual My particular car must have spent a lot of time in the garage based on the low mileage tight feel and nearly flawless interior and exterior I thought Id miss the quick openclose of the top that I had with a Miata but this power top is fast and seems well made On the road the blue color seems one of the least common  I really am satisfied with my new car It drives and handles like a much more expensive car Love the Windevil Blue and Parchment color  I bought this car as a present to myself for getting my graduate degree Im a single mom and so tired of being practical My kids and I love cranking the music and putting the top down There are a few small things Id change but I have so much fun with this car Even ordered a vanity plate   My Mustang GT California Special is more than I expected and has plenty of power and rides great The 3 valve engine just keeps pulling and the suspension is smooth and tight The California package is worth the price and I love the car  The quality is superb the interior comfy back seats a bit tight This thing is super I highly recommend that anyone looking for a convertible test drive this car last Fully decked out it was still 8000 less than the EOS and the convertible top is flawless  You might like the looks of the Vette as we have from the outside but here the looks are inside too great seating and be careful for that accelerator pedal  Excellent all round fun to drive car Our V6 is equiped with the optional Pony package This really helps out in the handling dept with added rear anti sway bar ABSand 17 alloy rims Take one for a drive Youll love it  The 2004 Anniversary Convertible is the way to go to celebrate your mid life crisis The styling is sleek and the sonic blue is a classly color with twin 10 silver bumper to bumper stripes The V6 has more than enough power and the automatic shifts extremely smooth The convertible top is quiet at highway speeds and is so simple to raise and lower The bucket seats are firm and there is enough leg room and head room Forget about the back seats being comfortable they are there for looks only not for carrying passengers But heck the Stang is for having fun for two The interior is well designed and controls are easy to reach and use The fit and finsh is better than some more expense car  When they stopped making the Trans Ams in 2002 I never thought Id get the sport convertible I always wanted Then the new body style Mustangs came out in 05 and I secretly craved one for my driveway  After biting the bullet and admitting that I loved this Ford despite it being a Ford Ive got one It is an amazing ride and there is nothing like the feel of the wind blowing through your hair at 80 MPH on the interstate Watch out though  Its very easy to just keep right on accelerating and never even notice I had it up to 100 and it felt just as smooth and sturdy as at 65 Overall the Mustang is a good buy  I love this car It is very fun to drive and it is very stylish All of my friends love my car It is very reliable and I have never had any trouble with it It never leaks because of the top and the top comes down very quick  Great car at a lower than expected price lots of powerhandles very wellcar still a favorite of many onlookers even when compared to new styling some prefer it to the retro look It is also a car well supported by the aftermarket suppliers so custom accessories abound Happy with mine after three years of ownership  I bought a convertible before I got too old to appreciate it and Im glad I did My grandkids complain Im too old to be driving such a hot car Car is an absolute blast to drive head and shoulders better than my 2000 GT coupe Car looks super with top down and I frequently get compliments Power top has been troublefree no leaks to date Biggest issue I have is interior squeaksrattles I never had with my 2000 GT which are annoying when top is up Shaker 500 stereo is nice but Im not sure speakers are suited to it Rear defrost switch is in awkward position hard to operatesee when in 5th gear Using cupholders can make shifting awkward Still a tremendous value super to drive  I just bought a 2007 Mustang V6 which is my first new car and a serious step up from my old beater I absolutely love the way it looks and its a blast to drive The interior looks great and is very comfortable with only 2 exceptions Having a manual tranny I find the cupholders are not very good and the car really need an overhead handle on the passenger side Other than that the car is great Its fun to drive looks great and is still resonably roomy for a sports car  I bought this car a year and a half ago with 24000 miles now it has a bit over 50000 Absolutely no mechanical issues to date Always starts right up even in the dead cold of winter Plenty of power for a V6 and gas mileage is good for a V6 I was wary to buy a Ford after owning an 1989 Escort in the past that was garbage but this car looked so shiny and lonely when I first saw it just pleading to be driven and I fell in love with it Its such a pleasure to drive especially with the top down Its a real head turner too I always get complements on it I highly recommend this car and would definately buy another Mustang in the future Take car of it and it will take care of you  Incredibly fun to drive and comfortable Acceleration is exhilirating and stopping performance is above expectations  High performance better than average fuel economy Still a tight package on the interior needs a little more shoulder and hip room Handling is very good Plenty of power on tap when you need it  I love this car I get looks and comments everywhere from total strangers and they all love the design and performance Vista blue is an awesome color with the white stripe Fit and finish is great I test drove a Solstice Pontiac G6 and a Mitsubishi Spyder convertible This car blows them all away and is cheaper to boot It also has a trunk thats pretty darn large and a back seat that is adequate I am getting between 21 and 25 mpg and have plenty of power  First had a 67 and of course regret ever getting rid of it Bought this as a leftover in December 06 for a steal loaded with rebates dealer concessions etc  Best buy in a car ever  Solid as a rock  Fast and the sweetest engine rumble  Handles exceptionally well and goes almost as quick as my supercharged 01 Jag XKR  Rougher more raw power but it adds to fun  Amazingly solid for a conv   A truly fantastic value with auto premium everything etc  Great car  Tempts me to get rid of my Jag and match this conv with an 08 fully loaded GT coupe  Purchased the car privately about 6 weeks ago and have had a blast with it since  A few road trips taken my 2 boys and their friends for rides just a real fun experience Ive had about a dozen cars and even a few trucks revving engines and wanting to race Also had lots of comments on the nice ride one fellow with a PT cruiser convertable even made an offer to buy it at a stop light  I had a 77 Cobra back when and I have to admit you really can go back with this car  If you want to have fun you cant really go wrong with this ride   Couldnt wait for the Camaro so I bought a Mustang GT convertible  I am not greatly impressed with the 300 HP  I would have bought a Shelby except for the 25K upcharge  This car is the love of my life Unfortunately the Colorado State Police pay way too much attention to it too  I bought a 5 speed  cant imagine driving an automatic When I want to pass someone on our mountain roads I leave them in my dust  by the way  Im a baby boomer lady I love the shift throw  have no problem with the clutch I do wish the CD changer digital readout was easier to see  My only problem with this car is the convertible lock down system  I also drive on some bumpy dirt roads  the convertible top shakes  shimmys more than it should  There are also some serious blind spots to watch for I love my mag wheels  the Bullet sound Not much winter driving tho  I have been driving a 2001 GT convertible for a few years and fell in love with the new model once I saw the design however the design is only the tip of the iceberg  This is a much better car than the SN95 version its faster the transmission doesnt feel like a pickups my girlfriend can push down the clutch and its no longer a rattlebox  The car keeps pulling through 4th gear and doesnt feel like youre inside of a B17s nacelle over Germany like the old one did  This is a very comfortable car and no longer feels like the boy racer my 2001 was  That was a very solid car but the new model is in a new class its a grownups car that makes you feel like youre 16  After searching all the competitors out there including the German and Japanse cars how could anyone not consider a Mustang I bought a GT convertible Wow for the money this car has no peer Right out of the box the power and handling of this car are fantastic To think I can get addon accessories to boost this performance to even higher levels without breaking the bank is even better Top down driving is fun Your passengers in the back may ask you to roll up the windows on the freeway but in the front seats the wind is manageable The family loves the car and want to take it everywhere Four seats Great stereo with excellent bass response Very comfortable seats Im over 6 too  This car has only one problem The space on the speedometer between 55 and 80 is to thin You will get into trouble if you dont keep an eye on your speed No rattles squeaks or defects  As for the ownership experience this car was built on August 8th and was not delivered until October 7th    I had an attack of patriotism so I had to buy American also 3rd midlife crisis More comfortable than I would have imagined corners great and I love the sound A little clunky but hey its a Ford Fast enough that you have to watch the speedometer I drove from Idaho to NY and averaged 70 MPH I got 24 MPG on regular gas Whats not to like A lot of fun for the money  Just bought a new Mustang to get back in her good graces after selling the 64 12 that was too dangerous for the family  Wow the car is great  I cant remember the last time when I bought something and thought it was worth 4050 more than I paid  Why cant Detroit make more cars like this I hate buying German but generally they are superior Lots of fun  A head turner at this price  I just bought a 2006 GT Conv with 13000 miles  Ive had it two days and already love it  My other vehicle is a Mazda CX9 for the family  This one is fun for me and I can still haul the family for fun trips  With the GT V8 Im surprised that Im averaging 2023 mpgnot bad considering the 300 horses and irresitible urge to nail it and nail it and well you get the point  Buy this vehicle  If  are tight I recommend an 06 or 07great bargains out there  I personally chose a used GT instead of a new V6  I would have considered a used 05 but I never get a car its first year in productionno idea if theres any real basis in that just my personal hangup  I purchased my Mustang about 2 years ago in Florida and then moved back north  This car has been wonderfully reliable taking me to and from Florida  My only complaint regarding long trips is that the drivers seat is horribly uncomfortable and I really get poor gas mileage  Until recently I havent had any problems with the car  Lately the convertible top back near the window has been leaking and now I am dealing with wet floors  I think it is mostly due to the Florida sun drying out the top for 5 years since it was never garage kept I get tons of compliments though    Just purchased this car after 3 years of deciding wheather to get one Love the new design and got a great deal so I went ahead I have been so pleased with the way this car makes me feel how it drives and the awesome power at my fingertips The stereo and some features are great  Love my Emily   Being a Euro car snob I was more than surprised with how much I liked my wifes midlife crisis car The new Mustangs have everything I always liked about American cars and none of the problems The convertible is quiet dry easy to use and little buffeting compared to other convertibles The car handles extremely well it is very controllablepredictable on the track and well balanced The power is amazing but what would I know I used to drive a Fiat By far the biggest surprise with this car is how comfortable the car is on long trips I can drive 800 miles and feel great when I get out So far I get 187 mpg overall which is okay considering the power and automatic transmission   I have to say how surprised I am that after owning my Mustang for over six months I still smile every time I drive it The looks the feel the way it handles all top notch   This is the 3rd 6 cyl Mustang Ive owned and this one is by far my favorite The fit and finish is great the performance is so far beyond my 95 that its closer to the fox body v8 I like it so much that this is the first Stang that Im upgrading visualy and performance wise Thats saying something about the passion this car causes in me as my first Stang was purchased in 1973 My only complaint would be the fuel fill problem that occurs once in awhile the tank wont take a fill up at times Overall all I can say is that it kills me from Nov to April when I store it   It has been 20 years since I owned a stick shift  I forget how much fun driving can be That is if you get into a mustang GT Great powerlooks an awesome sound system This car is just an incredible car to drive For the money you cannot buy this power good looks and a vehicle this fun to drive I looked into buying Mustangs in the past but did not do so because of the rough ride This cars ride and handling are that of much more expensive cars with much less to offer If you are looking for a start of the art computer based car this is not it but if you are looking for retro styling with updated technology this is the car for you  Best Mustang ever  Ride Hhndling and interior are super  real bank for the buck when compared to some more refined but much more expensive vehicles  350Z is nice  but doesnt have space to put a brief case  not as much fun and doesnt get the attention that the Mustang draws  V8 Power is fast fast fast  great powerband  torque everywhere  you could practically drive it in 3rd  The fun factor of driving this car is off the charts The engine with the cold air intake is the sweetest sounding engine that you have ever heard with a low high pitched whistle  Get the seat warmer option and you can drive it with the top down over 40 degrees  I picked it up in Tampa and the 8 hours I spent driving it home was as much fun as a man can have with his clothes on  Handling is superb and the front seats are extremely comfortable with the ability to actually lean your head back on the head rest to prevent fatigue  Very pleased and happy with the purchase a month into the ride   I was waiting for a car like this my whole life  I love it  The ripping engine sound the style the interior  The new traction control the old Mustangs lacked    I love this GT This is my first GT convertible I wasnt looking for this style mustang when I firsted started but this car caught my eye and I couldnt past it up Def wont stay shock for long I def have one of the fastest cars in the town Not to make cars will smoke this car Definitely worth all the money I paid for it   Just purchased this car 2 weeks ago to relieve my midlife crisis I was smiling all the way home driving it with the top down This car is all I expected and more Probably not the most comfortable ride for some its not a Lexus but this is more of a sports car and I do like the feel of the road coupled with the 5 speed manual transmission Amazing pickup very easy to go way over the speed limit seems to always want to go faster gas mileage not bad for a GT Leather buckets are comfy Have always had good luck with Fords Im hoping this one will also be as reliable   I bought this car for 17000 from a blonde girl who owned for only 9 months and only 11000 miles The reason im saying this is because she bought a MB CLK coupe with 45000 miles for 30000 Go figure I love this silver convertible mustang since the very first day The car looks great I added 20 black wheels and lowered 2 People on the street always stare I have owned this car since Dec 2000 The only thing that I have change on this car is the oil and brakes once Oh I also upgraded the headlights to all clear and smoke the tailights The car has 105k miles and I will keep it for many more years The car has been super reliable   Im 70 yrs old and this is the car I have been waiting for So much fun to drive Mine is dark candy apple red with parchment top Always good comments Boy could I have gotten into a lot trouble if I had something like this in school  I picked up my 2008 V6 Premium convertible this past Monday Very pleased so far I have a fully loaded car with the exception of NAVI Very comfy ride altho you will feel the bumps Very comfy and supportive seats V6 has plenty of pickup auto transmission Cant speak to reliability yet of course Dont know how good the fuel economy will be but I dont really care because its a fun car that probably wont be used all year round Too cold to put the top down yet unfortunately   We purchased this car one year old and it has been fantastic in reliability and retro style Love the convertable roof stereo is very good shaker 500 and the car drives extremely well We traded a very unreliable and quirky Mazda rx8 for this car and every time I turn the key the Mustang jumps to life and is eager to run The car handles very well considering its size and gives the driver a confident feel of the road always in control A 1500 mile trip to the coast turned in 26 mpg which is great considering the HPSize way better than the RX8 too In town average is around 18 mpg  My Legend Lime V6 convertible has been a wonderful experience I bought it instead of a motorcycle due to 2 little ones at home because it has a back seat  I drove it to Illinois by myself from Minnesota the first week I bought it and put the cruise on with the top down and tunes cranked  I havent had one repair It is hands down the best value for a sports car  I had 2 69 Stangs growing up and this one hasnt let me down for performance  Bought with 7k miles now at 26k no major problems just the same tail lamp keeps burning out Allcity driving yields terrible gas mileage but cruising on hwy at 70mph I get 28mpg easy Installed AirAid conical air filter which made huge difference in throttle response power and exhaust note In 2nd gear at 3000 rpm watch out Very fast Fullsize luggage can fit in trunk something most convertibles cant boast Stereo is amazingly powerful even on hwy wroof down Brakes could be better Bumpy roads reveal rattles and looseness mainly in windows  roof But for combo of V8 power stickshift control topless motoring mega style and storage space theres no competition at all  Where do I start I bought this car with 14000 miles In feb 07 a month later I had it back to the dealer for the paint coming off the bumper Got that fixed 2 weeks later my school books where soaking wet I left my bookbag in the trunk I thought the top was leaking but after 8 trips to dealer with the car being there for as many 30 days to get it back with same each time we cant find the major leak I have come to the conculsion that it is leaking from the weld in the body Back to body problems the Mustang stripe has come off 2 times I finally got tired of the dealer being so blind to the problem I called a lemon law lawyer so now I have a pending lawsuite against Ford For all my trouble  We bought the car new 206 By August had trouble fueling it Ford said some cars are hard to put gas in They did nothing about Will not do anything about it even under warranty For me it cured me of ever owning a Ford again Much less a mustang  Grew up always wanting a 70 Mustang GT fastback Finally I am fortunate to buy a toy and was happy to purchase a convertible that is this much fun to drive I get such a rush from hearing the engine rumble on Car has power I needed to get my sports car fix It is toy for me but I am going to drive it more than originally planned I hope my Mercedes and Jaquar dont get jealous  When the new design Mustang came out in Â’05 Â– I just loved the looks Well I decided to build one just the way I wanted and ordered an 06 GT convertible with every option except the auto trans how dare you  and the 1000 watt stereo I wanted as much truck space as possible  Well I love it The build quality is great The performance is exhilarating And it is always fun fun fun A few issues were taken care of by the dealer  he bent over backwards to them make right  The car just works  And looks great doing it  IÂ’m even surprised about how well the resale value has kept up   I have always wanted another Mustang since the 69 I had and I finally got it It is everything I hoped it would be So much fun to drive When Im out with the top down years and wrinkles melt away and Im young again All my friends want one now  Bought the car in 2005 with 33000 miles fun to drive but gets the same 2022 mpgin city or highway driving Needs on more high end gear ratio so car doesnt stop when you take your foot off gas Interior quality is poor Automatic door lock dont work and the plastic trim is falling off I live in AZ and the air conditioner is very poor in hot weather Car overheats and a really big drag on the engine   I had been shopping around for convertibles and one day I happened to stumble upon this one Im glad I went with this car because it was probably the best convertible with a decent amount of performance Ive come across for my price range I have an automatic model and prefer a manual transmission but because this car is so much fun to drive and its my daily driver I dont mind not having control of the gears Ive only had the car for less than a week and bought it with 86000 miles so I cant say much about reliability It eats gas up in the city but you have to kind of expect that from a V8  I purchased the car with 1000 miles on it I have had zero problems with it Odometer reading is 15000 I drive it mostly in the summer with the top down Installed Ford racing headers x pipe exhaust and a hurst shifter This car is more fun than any man has a right to have  Ive just turned 30000 miles and have enjoyed each one of them No reliability issues Have only seen the dealer for routine service This car is my dailydriver rain shine or snow It has never failed to get me home even in the snow Ive added a strut tower brace and a moreefficient louder exhaust The exhaust seems to have helped the gasmileage avg 21 22mpg mixed cityfreeway It is a comfortable car to take a trip in and the 500 watt stereo is fine No squeaks or rattles  Ive always wanted a convertible now I have one The car is fun to drive very comfortable for a sports car and I am really suprised at how great the ride is I expected more road noise with the top up so I am pleasantly surprised at the lack of noise You can carry on a conversation with a passenger in normal tones with the top down Same goes for listening to the radio The V6 has plenty of power for an old guy like me late 40s and is pretty quick also  The limited editionbuild 2008 Bullitt Mustang is loaded with fun this car has great acceleration thanks to the 373 gears although it effects your mileage Ive been averaging about 17 mpg even though I put my foot into it with regularity Another nice thing in this day of high gas prices is that the vehicle runs on either premium or regular unleaded With regular unleaded you supposedly lose a little torque but I can tell you that you dont notice it A good compromise is the plus grade if available  It look me years and years to get my Mustang Wanted a 66 because of the body style but had to wait for the restore until my body style was available Love the car the gas mileage is ok with the tough gas prices lately but love the car   Loved the car Im 65 260 bodybuider frame and never felt crowded lots of legroom Usually got around 22 mpg per fiilup No problems Just got the fever for the new Jeep unlimited Sahara 4dr but will probably regret the trade  The 05 Mustang convertible in dark red with tan leather and premium interior is a fun to drive beautiful all American head turner It handles and sounds great for a V6 and its classic looks are terrific I grew up in Detroit in the 70s so I guess I am the target audience for the design and they hit the target  I bought this car in 2001 with 60k miles on the car My wife wanted a convertible and this car had a higher entry into the car than the GM F bodies So I work a good deal and drove it home Within 6 month I had to replace the alternator and battery No biggy About to months later the coil pack Well this went on about every 4 to 5 months Also within the first year I had to remove the intake and clean it because of carbon build up For use a poorly designed valve cover which lets engine gases escape into the PVC line At 120000 miles the head gasket blew and I had enough of this car breaking down The door windows hit the top when opening and closing 2005 got the better idea fix  This is a great car I love how it handles I have the automatic and it shifts smoothly and no real hesitation in regards to power I get an average of 19 mpg around town and got 25 mpg up in the mountains The V8 is powerful and easy to control the exhaust note is fantastic The California package is a good package for the money much better than the lame Shelby package  not the 500   I bought V6 5 speed red Mustang in 2005 and has 47k miles already No mechanicalelectrical issues Cons no real pick up in first gear tires of low quality poor track in winterrain conditions stereo of low quality keeps the cds inside some cabin noise reverse shift difficult to engage plastic interior of low quality cupholders useless in current location dings and bells for seat belts and other conditions extremely noisy and loud Pros almost everything else design speed comfort for 2 passengers of course trunk space fuel economy reliability etc    Ive only had Japanese or German cars but the Mustang has always stirred my interest a little despite my general disdain for American designThat is until this new body style came along I must admit that I warmed up to it quickly and before long I just had to have it I wanted a convertible actually did not mind a V6 and realized that since Im a family man now there are not a lot of choices out thereSolara anyone Or worse Eos The Mustang fit the bill Classic style  history raw power and seats 4 to boot Got the V8 who needs the radio when you have the rumble from the exhaust for entertainment Crazy torque handles well for its size and looks gorgeous with the top down  I have had this car for over a year now and I love it  It is fun to drive and gets respectable gas mileage for what it is However I have had several nonengine related mechanical issues  I have had to replace all 4 power windows this year and my Mach CD player broke and is expensive to fix  I have also had to fix the power window switch But the engine has been flawless If you want a simple fun convertible I highly recommend this car  I have owned classic hot rods from the 60s this is as much fun to drive with the comforts of new options This is my second Mustang GT convertible love it  I have owned this Mustang GT Black Convertible since 2003 It has never broken down or given me any trouble First had it in Germany and I could set the cruise control for 110mph and it would ride steady Added a set of flowmasters and KN air intake and it sounds amazing Trunk space is very small One time something was placed in the back window and I put the top down and the window shattered so be careful putting anything by the back window Gas mileage is fair about 250 miles on a 14gal tank about 18 MPG I could ride it a little easier but who really does Seat head rests are too low if you are 6ft tall and a little uncomfortable if you are tall Little back seat space Fun fun fun  Had my convertible now since May My 2 year old loves going for a top down ride The wife even likes it I love the car but it is nowhere near perfect and is about to get some serious competition  I bought my Mustang GT back in May of 01 and had the car till Feb of 08 This car was very well taken care of and I drove the car pretty crazy The only reason I kept it running so well is because my uncle is a mechanic so most of the problem were fixed by him I pumped regular gas in it but always used 1030 oil When it got to 75000 miles I started using 1030 high mileage mobil oil fully synthetic That was the best oil I used My car never leaked any oil because I always replaced any gaskets or seals that needed replacing Changed all the normal wear  tear stuff Always kept the car original except for the flowmasters When I ran a smog check  it had better results than a brand new Mustang  Lifelong owner of sport sedans from Far East or Europe Living out a childhood vision of owning a sports car with a great American V8 Car is engineered around the powerful engine not much else Unlike products from other domestic makers the understated styling and lack of cheezy exterior addon is quite appealing Obviously this is a recreational vehicle so it does not dissappoint great engine sound accelaration is pretty linear and suspension is a good compromise Not meant to make social statement so no complaints about 15 to 24 mpg Overall not a perfect car and not for everyone but just a fun personal toy to have in your garage  I bought this car a few months back and I am just in love with it Being a V6 I was expecting very little power but after a cold air intake an exhaust and a short throw shifter this thing is fast I would recommend this car to anyone  Ive driven 2 Altimas  a Corolla before this vehicle Big step up in fun factor and performance I dont know of any speedy chic autos that can compare to Mustang convertibles when it comes to price Im glad I have it and am seriously considering buying a GT in the future Ford please dont change the body style Id like to see the interior improved but most people who are aware of Mustang realize that cheap interior is par for the course Besides that would increase the price Some small mishaps occurred in year 1 the windows malfunctioned at times the trunk light went loose the turn signal had problems Driving out to the beach is a blast Better than a Sebring or Solara   I have been wanting a Mustang since I rented twice on business trips over the past few years The car is just 100 fun to drive and own People smile when you pass by and my kids think Dad is the coolest The car handles well for an solid axle performance car The ride is not rock hard but firm Gas mileage is actually decent getting between 1925 mpg if you keep a light foot Push the pedal and watch the car go If you need even more power get the 500 HP Shelby GT500 This will do the job on your Hemi Challenger and the new Camaro The 18 rims and tires are a must they fill out the wheel wells nicely Shaker 500 audio is almost audiophile quality Have fun   I work downtown Los Angeles and park at the country club with all sorts of exotic cars let alone your M6s S8s etc but the valet guys favor my car The people from GAS Pimp my ride spruced it up with 20 inch Boss wheels Bassani exhaust cold air in take computer chip and Eibach lowered suspension In all Ive spent an extra 10k on extras and it was well worth it  This care simply cant sit still and its made to gun it with a mighty roar Id only wish I would have used the 1200 bucks for the stereo and gotten an aftermarket system   This is my first Ford I am a GM man I wanted a sports car convertible made in America This was my only choice  I dont understand why Ford doesnt make Mustangs stock that is high performance Yes you can purchase from Saleen Rouch etc with all the goodies why not from Ford at least as options I added a hurst shifter chrome 20 wheels side stripes things to make it look better I must admitt I do get a lot of Nice Car comments Probably because I have over 100 coats of wax on it Mine is a candy apple red I do love the sound system I wished they had a hood scoop on my car even though it was a fake It does look good I purchased this car off the lot My Camaro was fast  Ive only had it for a few months now but I can honestly say its by far my favorite car Its luxurious and sporty at the same time while still living up to its muscle car reputation Very comfortable seats and great overall design I get compliments everywhere I go With 260 horsepower and so many aftermarket options this car is great for both everyday driving and taking to the track This car is an American classic and once you drive one youll understand why Its a must have I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants the best of both worlds in an automobile  I love this car I have the 5 speed automatic and it performs without trouble Sure the gas mileage isnt that great but really who would expect that from a muscle car The only trouble is the really noisy top latches The rattle like crazy with the top up At first no rattles but as the weeks went by the latches were rattling like crazy Ford replaced them and they were fine for a while now they are rattling again   This is a really fun car to drive  One thing that helped this car tremendously in handling was an Eibach lowering kit  before lowering it the car would get some serious body roll in the turns After lowering it I sacrificed some of the cushy ride but owning a Mustang isnt about being cushy The delayed throttle response due to the flybywire technology is a little strange to get used to but can be compensated for by adding a hydrogen assist kit  supposed to help with gas mileage and it does by about 12 mpg but in this car with a tune it actually added about 1215 hp which seems to all come in during the low rpms improving throttle response and the seat of your pants launch  I really miss my car Someone just hit and ran me in a head on collision It looked like a small fender bender but after the mechanic looked at it they said the bar the transmission is attached to really bent Making this car totaled I am so sad I loved it Bought it new and drove it for 10 years Would have lasted forever had this not happened And it was beautiful I like it much better than the newer models Sad sad day for me  Too good looking to pass up always wanted a muscle car A blast to drive and love the burble of the exhaust Agree with other comments that 1st is too short and 5th too tall Gas mileage seems to vary wildly for no particular reason from 1117 around town Prehistoric technology that makes me smile  I have had many convertibles and sports cars and my GT is right up there with the best ever for all around fun and value I also have not had many vehicles that get so many people coming over to check it outa real eye pleaser    I have owned a few Mustangs and typically leave the exterior plain and spend the time and effort on modifying the engine and suspension My wife and I both saw a 2008 Bullitt in the Highland Green and were immediately drawn to the cars understated simplicity of styling that made the cars we loved as teenagers such classics Then I drove one  The changes are subtle from the 2006 GT I have been driving for 3 years but the suspension is firmer and the shifter is more precise The power difference negligible over the GT but the car just looks and sounds right  If you grew up driving V8 muscle cars in the 60s and 70s or wanted to and couldnt afford to this is your car  I had wanted a Mustang since my teen years and bought one 30 years later I bought the base model I havent had any trouble with it since purchasing Has great get up and go I love shifting gears  Holds the road great and that says something with all the winding country roads we have in WV Good gas mileage on the highway not so good in city   I have always loved Ford automobiles As a mom I got an Explorer for the diversity of our family Then when I hit my thirities and the get were older something was missing Our family wanted something that was fun and still practical to drive because gas was almost 450 per gallon I was going to get something before my midlife crisis We test drove a Mustang convertible and the family fit so we bought the car I love this car There is nothing I would change I have enough room for everthing When you down size from an Explorer then all that kids stuff you just stop bringing everything Boy do my kids smile when the top is down Moms go for it  Bought this car after convincing my wife we needed a convertible Since we have a child we needed something with a back seat Since I needed a sports car re not FWD the Mustang was the only real option After years of disliking Mustangs Fox platform versions and driving several Japanese cars Civics WRX etc I was pleasantly surprised how quickly this car reminded me whats important in a cara good sounding and performing engine great looks and backtobasics simplicity which means living with some shortcomings The rear live axle can feel a little unplanted on rough roads during spirited cornering The interior materials quality is also lowrent in look and feel  I bought my Mustang used I have always loved the Mustangs The only problem I had with mine is somebody changed the rear end oil and didnt seal it properly I had to replace the gears and lsd I replaced the 327s with 355s Amazing I have alot of mods intake exhaust gears suspension rims tires shifter audio hand held tuner The car responds well to mods Through on an Eibach Pro System Plus Kit with good tires and the handling becomes go kart like I recommend buying a Swarr Bar for the rear axles if you have a GT This will make the car more predictable on take off and in corners Only true problem I have had is the traction control kicking in too fast I just turn it off  I first drove a 05 Mustang V6 and after that I just had to own the new style Mustang My 07 GT convertible is a real blast to drive Cant decide whether to listen to the exhaust or the 500 watt stereo Like other comments the gas mileage acceleration and handling is superb in this car This is a true muscle car in my opinion The 300 HP v8 engine has plenty of power Mine is the torch red color with the hood scoop option I get comments all the time about the looks of it No rattles or problems since I got it new and its just over 2 years old now Will keep this car for a long time Paint quality is super on mine I have keep everything stock on it for now  Fun engine Comfortable interior Poor build quality several of misfittedmisaligned body panels convertible top issues windows are aligned differently when compared to each other etc Longterm reliability unknown but build quality leaves something to be desired  Price likely reflects use of cheap parts which could call into question longterm durability In summary its a fun modestly priced convertible with questionable quality control and unknown longterm reliability  It just does not give the same warm fuzzy that a Honda or Lexus does in terms of solid build quality right off the dealer lot Buy only after you have noted these cautions  We had a choice between a few beautiful stangs and bought this 04 40th anniversary edition Fully loaded with a Mach stereo system I upgraded the air filter plugs and oil which made a major difference I run at least 2528 mpg even going 80mph It handles very well drove through a wy winter storm and stuck to the road Gotta love my 39L  I imported my 2008 Black Mustang Convertible pony package from US to UAE United Arab Emirates being a sports car lover for years it was my dream come true but from the first day itself I was disappointed as far as comfy quality and power are concerned I thought Dodge Charger is more refined and comfortable mustang behaved like my 1997 Ford Explorer though I thought Explorer is better in comfortability But the moment I drop down the top it became totally different species all together I became the center attraction and it was fun to drive around in neighbor hood with loud music on Better than my 1999 Camaro Convertible All complaints are vanished   I bought this car as my first sports car and have been loving every minute of it The sound the ride the style everything is amazing With an intake tune and an exhaust system and the car turned into a completely different animal I have the California Special in Performance White and it stands out from even other Mustangs  I have enjoyed my Mustang convertible for 3 years It makes driving fun Top is down unless its raining ACHtr work fine to keep me comfortable in Texas heat Its my car its my funits my identity  After owning a 98v6 mustang and investing almost 2000 on paint rims body work and lights I new I needed a v8 I bought my gt because I got a good deal and because Ive always wanted a v8 mustang Acceleration is awesome you can hear this thing breathe Handles well also Takes corners like its on rails Interior is ok not as bad as some say well to my standards Leather is great convertable top is awesome Mpg is not that bad for me I get around 18 city and 26 on highway I have a heavy foot too Love the retro style Dont regret purchasing this beast Wish I had more power but I can fix that with aftermarket stuff  Girlfriend and I recently purchased the GT with less then 70000 miles  Engine runs as good as anyone I have ever driven  The power is NICE  Dont have to worry about passing traffic or getting on the freeway  Its nice knowing those 300 pounds of torque are ready on tap anytime you need them  The car looks great with the top down and sure is a head turner where ever we go  For a 2002 model this car can almost kick the living crap out of any other car on the road when it comes to racing  260 horse power and 302 pounds of torque well you get the picture  060 in 54 secs and a quater mile time of 1400 at 101 miles an hour well that sure beats most imports by a mile even in 2009  An all around great quality car  I highly recommend it  The V8 has plenty of power I have added exhaust and Intake which are a must for this model  The exhaust adds that mean rumble while the intake adds hp and saves major gas  The only down side is the interior is cheap but doesnt look too bad  It is also rough in the winter but what car isnt  I test drove a mustang convertible 16 years ago but put off the purchase because of the insurance cost  16 years later I finally purchased a 2010 gt prem convone of the benefits of getting oldlower insurance costs and could not be happier  This car is true American muscle car its powerful fun to drive and a great value  The cons axle handling are all shortcomings I can live with  So if you are in the market for a muscle car I would highly recommend this car  I considered buying a  late 60s early 70s muscle car but decided that the Mustang would give me the same thrillfeel without the hassle of dealing with an ongoing restoration project  I bought a 2002 GT new and it was a fun car but the insurance was too much and I had to sell it I just bought this 2001 GT convertible and it brings back all the great memories of that 02 but now the insurance is 13 the price I love these cars because they are the cheapest fun you can use to commute to work I get 27 mpg 130 miles a day and my 3 year old loves it Its loud flowmaster fun fast and engaging for a person that loves cars Why anybody would commute in a boring daily driver I cant understand when you can get these things so cheap used and they get decent mileageI was buying a new Challenger this year but think I made the right choice   What a great car If ford had been making these cars 10 years ago they wouldnt be in the trouble there in Every one needs a convertible this is a great one wish it had a little more horse power but if it did I wish it had even more  My car has the shaker stereo leather etc  I was surprised that the Radial TAs it came with stunk  got rid of those tires and replaced them with some hot Falkens  now it handles GREAT  It is really just a two seater tho  dont really know why Ford had to design the rear seat with the back practically straight up but it makes sitting back there a painful experience if more than a couple blocks  The front seats are great  and LOTS of leg room  You can see the seams in some of the plastics which detracts from an otherwise well executed interior design  I bought the V6 thinking it would get better mileage  I shoulda got the 8 I think it mighta got better mileage  I have always wanted a convertable for my long commutes home This is real therapy I love my car it has been very reliable No problems AT ALL from 60110000 miles Ive had it Soon it will need some maintanence but probably expected Gas mileage could be better but its an older car with a TON of power under the hood Pretty comfortable but the back seat is impractical for adult use I think only small kids actually fit Good sized trunk for the size of the car and it always feels safe  I like the traction control feature and the handling is superb Its an easy ride although mine is a little loud which makes it difficult to hear sometimes Its been a great ride and lots of fun  I bought my convertible GT in Febuary and fell in love She had less than 25000 miles on her when i bought it Very reliable and very fun to drive She really has some pick up and go Not only is the convertible fun to drive its fun to play with as well I have flowmaster mufflers a cold air intake and various other modifications The cool thing about mustangs is that its not just a car it can be a hobby  just purchased my 2009 V6 convertible mustang it had 9500 miles when purchased I drove it to Pensacola Fl the next week and it drove great with good gas mileage so far I have really enjoyed this car the style and ride is really great No problems at all  I just got this 2010 vehicle on Monday July 6 2009  I have always wanted a yellow convertible since I was 5 years old  Im now 71 and I must say my Sunset Gold Mustang is all I hoped it would be  Its like driving a big computer so much to learn about the car  However it is very comfortable and easy to drive  It has a lot of pickup for a V6 and I love the Sirrus Radio  I really dont know what else to say escept its the fun car to drive especially with the top down whether you are 20 or a Senior Citizen  I am the original owner of my 01 convertible and I am extremely impressed with the build quality  Other than scheduled fluid changes I have not had a single issue  The car starts everytime it is fun to drive and for what it is an entry level sports car I am a very satisfied customer  Having owned a 95 coupe this car is superior in every way  I have modified the car with dual exhaust w GT bumper hood  side scoops a fibreglass front bumper tires  rims welded subframe connectors strut tower brace pedal kit and new air intake  Well my wife traded in her mountaineer for a mustang  Having her midlife crisis  She got the V6 premium with automatic and convertible  She also had the GT stripe installed over the hood and trunk  The color of the car is Kona blue  Very sharp looking and we get looks where ever we go  Car is well put together and solid  Ford really addressed past weakeness in the car  Car gets good mileage on the highway  We went out to Pa on business with straight open highway driving and the car got 26 MPG doing 70  Not bad for less than a 1000 miles on the car  If someone is looking for a two door sports coupe they should look at this first before going to the imports  My daughter and soninlaw bought this car for me brandnew as a gift in 2000  I love this car and have lots of fun driving it  It has never had anything go wrong with it in the 9 years that I have owned it  It is a beautiful black convertible very sleek and sporty  This is my second Mustang owned the first model in 1965 and I highly recommend them  We have several mustangs but this is the boss of them all Love the design and the handling of the car  Love the microsoft synch  Car is fun to drive and great to look at  Bought it new and have 63k miles  Never a problem  Added some goodies headers catback CAI 373 rearend and hurst short throw  360hp  Love this car  I still get comments from people I have never had a brake job and Im at 63k miles and still have 20 wear left  Solid solid solid is what this car is  I wont ever get rid of it  Best thing Ford ever did  Just bought the car new a few weeks ago Have been enjoying it ever since Lots of compliments on the car especially the color Kona Blue metallic Plenty of power decent comfort and handles surprisingly well for its size Nice stereo Sync system works well but takes a while to figure out  Always wanted a muscle car but got married young while my friends were driving Mustangs Road Runners and Corvettes  Now they are driving mini vans while I am cruising in my GT convertible  Started talking to my wife about getting a Mustang since the 05 hit the dealers not really thinking that she would go along with it until one day she said if we get one can it be a convertible it was then that I knew she wanted it as much as I did  I hesitated about the convertible since I never had one and I remember the old  rag tops leaking with lots of wind noise  I test drove one and found it to be pleasanty quiet with the interior of the roof very plush hardly looking like a convertible  Ive had my car for three weeks V6 convertible Black on Black I have never gotten so many looks and compliments about a car before The styling is great the ride is fun this is my first Mustang Looked at other convertibles but this one I had to have     This car means only pleasure I am a Mustang lover this is the first one that I bought and I can tell you that the car is the best of the best Its retro style and power engine only can give you good moments Mine is convertible then drive with the top down is really a dream    I just bought my self a midlife crisis treat a 2002 Mustang GT convertible with a five speed manual tranny and  all the bells and whistles available in 2002  I was sitting in the Corvette I was going to buy when it caught my eye  There isnt a mark on it inside or out and is if I may use the term a freakin rocket  The sound system is incredible Yes old guys still rockbest thing I ever did for myselfif you dont have one get one     Only had the car 3 months and will store it for the winter  Inside and out this car reminds me of my all time favorite 67 Mustang  Car has Flowmaster exhaust sounds great awesome V8 rumble  Leather seats are very comfortable Mach 1000 stereo is outstanding  Seriously 100 mph top down tunes sound perfect  Original owner said only issue he had was door covers vibrating with tunes loud  Dealer packed the doors with insulation no more problem  Quality of interior materials is very good better than most cars  Fit and finish is excellent  Mileage is fairly good if you behave but thats tough to do   too much fun  Get one before theyre gone  An overall great car to drive and very very fun  Tons of power and very responsive steering I also test drove a convertible BMW 330i which also was responsive and great to drive but the Mustang won out due to the lesser cost and greater power  I have never owned a convertible but now I wont go back to a regular coupe  I cant say enough good things about this car  My whole life I have dreamed of owning a convertible but never thought that day would come Finally at Thirty years old that day came TRUE I researched all the different models of convertibles and none of the others compared to the Ford Mustang The Mustang rated the highest in safety which was one of my main concerns Another was the comfort and room for passengers and again the Mustang had it all    I commuted 160 miles a day in this and have 202000 on it  Engine still running great Top is now ready to be replaced last much longer than I thought  Im 63 yrs young and Ive had a lot of different cars in my life My last car got totaled so I went looking for a muscle car Im tired of 4s and 6s I loked around for about 2 months I found my perfect car a 1998 mustang gt convertible Ive had it for about 9 months and had a blast in it It had 120000 miles on it and I havent had a bit of trouble with it All my old friends ask me about gas mileage I tell them I could care less I give them a ride in it with the top down and they want to buy one Of course they have to glue their tupees on a little better I have trouble judging distances on parking so this is a great fit for me I will have no other car than a mustang  Love my convertible  Fun to drive and enjoy the power  If you have more than one child makes for a challenge if they want to take friends somewhere  Not much trunk space  Looks good and sounds even better  Didnt buy the car for fuel efficiency so gas mileage is not an issue for me  Multiple CD changer and sound system add to its appeal  Convertible top easy to operate  My Mustang was special ordered just for me  The car is everything I knew it would be and more  This is the second convertible mustang I have owned  The first was in 1984 Now 26 years later I have another one  Love the my color ambient lighting love the sync and navigation love the backup camera  Color choice was white wa black top and one of the striping packages also in black Im averaging 19 city and 24 highway I was thinking the mpgs would be a little better being that it is only a V6 engine but its still new and not broke in yet  I am so happy with my car  I did a lot of research before I made my decision and I couldnt have picked a better car LOVELOVELOVE IT  This is my 3rd Stang having previously owned an 86GT Hatch and an 86LX Cnvt Bought the 99 with 11000 miles in 2001 Currently has 145000 This is a great car Have had almost no mechanical problems Great style and performance Great exhaust sounds Mach 460 radioCD is great too Convertible top works well Tends to eat brakes Headlight covers do fog over Dont hit a bump in the middle of a turn or youll find yourself in the next lane  I bought this car used with 17000 miles and it was in perfect condition The acceleration is decent but could always use more power Handling has been excellent even in the 3 blizzards weve had this year You do get bounced around quite a bit on bumpy roads but then again its not exactly a luxury car My Color backlighting is a cool feature to play around with Insurance surprisingly wasnt that bad considering I live in NJ All in all this car has been amazing to own and a blast to drive considering its a 110 HP improvement over my previous car   If this were a car it would be a blond airhead that seduces you in the beginning but doesnt hold your interest and isnt reliable over the long run After three years the only part of the car I like is the V8 engine The suspension is crude and not up to the power of the engine The manual trans is hard to shift and the clutch is heavy This car requires a lot of attention to drive smoothly especially in anything but warm dry weather and Ive been to performance driving school The stereo is missing the midrange its all highs  lows and the menu system is dangerous to use while driving The ergonomics are horrible with cup holders in the way of the shifter and inadequate storage  I will never get another Ford My gear shifter is broken the top leaks the light knob is super glued on transmission is going out the leather is tearing passenger doesnt close right I can keep going but Ill stop now oh wait did I mention it gets CRAPPY gas mileage  This is my first Mustang and have enjoyed it so far Great looking Kona Blue metallic paint awesome V8 sound and handles well for its size and weight Gets lots of looks and compliments Everybody likes this car Except remorseful Camaro owners  I got mine used at 17000 miles and have put another 16000 miles on it  Now its 3 years old and runs great  Nice loud exhaust and with the top down Im amazed how many people pull up next to me and want to talk about my car  For a V6 its got lots of pep although if you romp on the gas it takes half a second to take off  I just purchased a used 2007 GTCS convertible for some summer fun  This car is a blast to drive on a sunny day with the top down  Great acceleration and exhaust note  It also handles better than I expected  The lower profile and 18 inch wheels on the California Special probably helps here  I bought this car strictly for weekend and pleasure driving and so far Im very pleased  Since the initial unveiling of the new body style for 2005 I have patiently yearned for a 2007 Mustang My wait finally came to a glorious end last Friday when I tradedin my 1997 V6 black coupe and purchased a 2007 Grabber Orange GT convertible To quote the 1975 Queen song title Im in love with my car The Mustang GT is all I expected and more First since this car is my fifth Mustang I have grown accustom to the tractionless rear end Yet the GT feels solid and attached to the road The car has a terrific low end sound yet quiet enough to hear the stereo passengers and yes the familiar convertible rattle But Ill take a little rattle over a minivan any day of the week  Oh yea  This car is a riot I ran with the stock motor for about 6 months then had a custom tuned blown four valve motor installed It cranks 630 RWHP Looks like a stock GT Needless to say I have a lot of fun leaving a lot of people in the dustBy the time they hear that supercharger whine they know they going to be looking at my tailights How can you not love one of these cars Rough and crude pure American muscle     Bought the car with 9000 km and 11 months old The car has 90000 km as of May 2010 The car has been bullet proof in terms of reliability I have just replaced the tires and the original battery The only issues have been Engine check light on briefly at 87K and selfcleared must have been a loose gas filler cap and the rear tail light bulbs blow every 15K or so 4 bulbbig deal Other than that just oil and filter changes Car has been very reliable and solid Body creaksgroans at 90K are still minimal but you can now tell the car is nearly 4 years old lots of life left in it I will replace shocks  struts this year and this should solve the problem  Overall a lot of fun and a great value among high performance cars Fit and finish to a surprising high standardthis is my first American car in many years and I had almost given up Powertrain is awesome and electronics suite is better than my Audi  Ergonomics and cabin convenience are sorely lacking  Glove box wont even hold manuals No place to put mailbox keys etc Cupholder makes shifting clumsy and needs better design Yes we do need a water bottle in the car in an AZ summer  My black Mustang rides like a buckboard the leather seats are flat the interior door panels and console are cheap Its a Mustang for crying out loud Its an icon a legend The Mach 6 CD amfm stereo is simply amazing Your choices for a convertible are rather limited A Chysler Sebring a Pontiac that they quit making a BMW with a price tag over two times any similar Mustang The Mustang is the only logical choice Smooth and easy top operation The trunk holds what it needs too Golf clubs baseball bags tennis rackets groceries 2 medium suitcases No its not big its a sports car not a luxo boat The people that complain about this car are ill please see a doctor   I bought the premier V6 convertible with the pony package because I did not believe I required a Hi performance sports car  After thorough research I decided on the V6 and consider a roadster  In that category it is a great vehicle that in my opinion out paces its competition in most areas  It is fun to drive and invokes pleasant responses from other people   Rides like a buckboard reasonable handling mileage and the Mach stereo is a beast If you dont like a Mustang convertible lets look at your choices An older Cavalier a Sebring or LeBaron that will likely have numerous issues a costly BMW or a Porsche that is likely beyond costly for similar year and miles Its the only choice out there under 12000 with low miles   For the past 10 years Ive been driving a BMW 330 convertible Audi A4 V6 and Porsche 964 but my 10 GT Mustang is most fun of all Had to install the FR3 handling pack to tighten it up but awesomely enjoyable now 315 hp is enough to move it around in any gear 5spd manual even with a 331 rear gear 18 mpg around town Tight build quality Grabber blue w1970 Mach 1 hood stripes Topped it off with Saleen 20 wheels   This is the second Mustang I have owned but the first one was about 20 years ago The car is as good as every review had written land more I actually got stopped by the police in rural Wisconsin to check on the missing license permit which was in the front window as the car is a CV What they really wanted to do is ask questions about the vehicle which they did  Bought this for a steal as Ford was trying to get rid of all the 2007s for the 2008s MSRP 36k and bought it for 27k  I have been VERY happy with it from day one  Not a single issue with the vehicle itself  The Tires did wear out VERY quickly at about 20k miles but I replaced them with some high quality aquatreads from Discount Tire  Awesome Shaker 1000 sound system SO much fun to drive just wish the kids  wife would let me keep the top down more   Of note I average 23 MPG on the computer in the car  I live in a rural area so most of my driving is 70 75 mph on back roads and in town I keep it in 5th gear when going 3540 mph love my stick shift  Have only put about 1000 miles on my new Mustang convertible but its already easily the best Mustang I have owned The power from this new V6 is outstanding and the handling and braking are top notch I have the 6 spd Auto and it handles the engine very well Steering is direct and well weighted controls all feel of the highest quality This is the first Mustang Ive driven that feels in many ways like my Hondas In fact with the real aluminum trim and fabulous Sync system this Mustang is more luxurious and sophisticated than most other cars in its price class And top down well nothing is better Top is thick and seals very well    This is the best car Ive owned  No one single mechanical problem after 5 plus years of ownership I had the opportunity to run this monster on the German autobahn at speeds in excess of 140 mph with the top down What an experience  Buy one you will not be disappointed  Great job on this one Ford  This 2011 V8 GT Mustang is incredible Its extremely fast and it rides and handles very good Mine has the 6spd auto trans premium trimmed Grabber Blue with the 401A interior trim pkge with the blue seat stripes and stitching I ordered the Shaker 1000 stereo which is totally awesome Got the exterior conv pkge 6 with dual side vents hood scoop deck lid trim panel and pedestal spoiler 19 inch painted nickel alum wheels very nice and probably rare Drop the top and enjoy it This is my ninth Mustang since 1968 Just started enjoying my car   I love my GTCS The performance is very exciting and the 46 does a nice job to really get this car moving I have an auto and its no slug it will get up and move when you want it to  The drop top is a very nice feature  Easy to operate and fairly quick to raiselower Due to the live rear axle you can experience some drivability issues when pushing the car around a turn with bumps in the road not enough for me to really consider it not drivable when pushed  I have the shaker 500 and its loud enough to hear with the top down while driving 80 For MPG you can get good numbers if you are being very good  Top down 1824 and up 2025  You can have a new car with just a few mods enjoy  Automobile magazine writers have had good reviews on this car and that encouraged me to check out the V6 305 HP engine 37 liter  My last V6 Mustang 1974 Mach 1 had a 28 liter Cologne engine  Absolutely no comparison possible The old car could get 25 MPG This car can get up and boogie and still give me 288 MPG on the freeway at 77 MPH  It has good handling characteristics good looks and good build quality My wife really liked the AC and the ride Our one gripe is a small trunk  Dont plan on bringing a lot of luggage if you take a 1000 mile trip unless you want to use the back seat for the extra suitcase We are very happy with the car  I purchased her brand new Worth every penny 10 years later she is still fun to drive Hugs roads and has great pick up I would buy again Issues were the exhaust manifold design is bad I think the AC drips onto it and as a result had to have it welded back together twice because it sounded like a hole in the muffler Also the clutch went out on her 2 years ago and that had to be replaced Other than those 2 things I have not had one single mechanical issue She is picky about her tires Anything but Yokahomas seem to run rough Extremely reliable Cosmetics after 10 years my top leaks in behind the back seat due to being left in the sun and not in a garage Middle tail light faded  I was concerned and apprehensive when I went from a Mercedes C230 Sport to the Mustang GT Convertible On day two I knew I made the right decision  This car rocks  The car generates amazing torque and speed  The exhaust and engine are perfectly matched it makes a deep throaty growl when I get on the accelerator  The handling is superb The first time I dropped the transmission into second gear going around a corner and goosed it Im sure I looked like the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland I had such a grin   This car is without a doubt more powerful responsive and refined than the 50 GT I bought new in 1990  I am so happy with this car I want to sleep in it Thank you Ford   I bought the car used with 65k miles  It was in great shape with exception of the leather driver seat and a small leak from the power steering hose  The leak never materialized to anything and the seat continued to deteriorate  Thats the worst of it  Otherwise it was  reliable fast and very fun  The gas mileage was better than my mini van  I did sell it but wish I didnt  It was a great car  My wife  I rented a 2010 Mustang convertible to drive from Kentucky to the NASCAR race at Watkins Glen in early August  That rental proved a stronger sales tool than any dealership could ever provide When reading the features of the 2011 model we decided they far outweighed any price savings obtainable from a 2010 year end deal  We love the styling peppy V6 305 hp with smooth sounding dual stainless steel exhausts  The sync system takes a little adopting to  My short drives tofrom work a a real joy whenever the top is down  Evening drives with the top down are exhilarating   This is my sixth Mustang since 1980 and my third convertible 1984 50LX V8 and 1987 GT V8 I had it out for a two hour top down drive today When you drive this new Mustang GT you feel as if youre an active part of the car It fits you so well and is that flawless in everything it does And its ride handling and V8 engine performance are all totally off the scale Fords new EPAS steering is incredible best ever They just seem to have gotten everything right on this car My Mustang was the first Mustang GT convertible sold by my dealer It was specially ordered by me and took exactly eight weeks as promised I took delivery on July 9th  The new styling is perfect This car triple black gets stares and comments almost every time I drive it Its comfortable extremely hot looking fast nimble and the sound from the pipes is music Build quality is fine price is reasonable and I fit my whole family in it What else can you ask for I could only rate fun to drive a max of 10 but I would have given it a 15 There are many accessories out there to personalize it and further improve performance so itll never get old The premium fuel is worth the extra cost Glad I didnt wait for the 2011 The 46 is plenty powerful and a tried and true performer while the 50 needs a few years of reliability history under its belt   This the best car i have ever owned It is black on black and I love to drive it I have never gotten so many complements on a car before when I put the top down people just stop and stare I test drove a lot of convertibles before my wife suggested the Mustang it was the last one I test drove got it that same day Did I say I love driving it I have become a Mustang Man      only had this about 2 weeks this is the first ford mustang i have owned so far everything is great love letting the top down and cruising around town  ur silver on black Pony was a retirement gift to ourselves We have owned 3 Vettes and a 65 Impala convert and the Pony has been the most fun economical and reliable We have put 93000 km 60k mi across most of Canada and winters in Arizona the past 3 years Winnipeg winter mileage is awful otherwise no fuel complaints Initially we had a couple of minor warranty claims otherwise wasted  buying extended service plan as problem free I follow the service book to the T and the car looks after us Large trunk hauls our water jugs and groceries to our cottage fine The heated leather seats are comfy and the car gets a lot of compliments   Good looks and fun to drive but the roof leaks above driver and passenger windows  After 2 dealer visits no help so far  Leaks in drivethrough car wash  Owners manual and Ford hot line maintain power washing could cause this problem but car was not exposed to power washer Havent driven in more than light rain so severity of problem remains to be seen  This pony pak V6 is one awesome Mustang  Every where I go People stop and stare or shout WOW handles and rides great and great power this is the best ride I ever bought and I have bought lots of them over the years the interior is pure quality and the paint candy red is flawless  I have a 67 Mustang also  The 11 is so retro  not like a Camaro  Buy one you wont be disappointed    This is the base v6 convertible Only option is the 6 speed auto All the positives in the reviews are spoton This car is sensational The negatives Ive read dont even apply at least to me My 61 son has sat in the back  with the drivers seat in normal position I am 6 He said he wouldnt want to sit there all day but even a couple hours would be fine That was a surprise  I thought the back seat was just for the insurance companies I have only 1000 miles on the car had it for 2 wks  and got 30 mpg on a 90 minute trip the other day And that included an  ahem  acceleration test on the highway A blast to drive and thats with the top up Top down  fantastic  I bought this car several months back with about 87k on it and Im already pushing 99k Other than an issue with the electrical system due to chewed up battery terminals a 6 fix it has been one hell of a ride I checked out camaros and a charger or two while I was searching but every mustang I sat in just felt more comfortable and even better I could actually see out of it After a few bolton modifications it can turn some heads Im hardpressed to say that Ill probably have at least a mustang in my garage at all times from now on You only get one chance at a first car and this nasty pony did the job  Wow That is all that is needed to be said This car is for anyone aged 16116 who wants to own the most fundollar vehicle on the market With sleek 1969 Mach 1 tribute styling the 2012 Mustang GT gives everyone the opportunity to own a piece of Muscle Car History and be the baddest car on the road The new Mustang is extremely light compared to the Camaro and the Challenger and with the 6 Speed Manual and 373 rear end this car is like a rocket both in the straight line and in corners It is extremely good looking extremely comfortable to drive and is unbelievable fast for the price Highly recommended to Everyone  I recently bought the GT convertible after looking at the Camaro and Challenger Immediately loved it but decided to add some stealth performance so had the Ford Racing supercharger instaaled along with Magnaflow exhaust to give a little more rumble Now 600 horsepower and fast not the word for it Now a Corvette killer The Camaro and Challenger dont even come close  I purchased a 1998 GT as a project car to keep and tinker with Needless to say this will be a good challenge for me There a few things to repair and customize Above all the engine is rumbling like a champ LOVE the engine and exhaust sound Black and tan interior match very well and replacement parts are fair in price I plan on doing some upgrades to the engines Even as a used car a GT 46L has a lot of power and will give incredible speeds Parents beware you should not buy your teenager such a powerful car Buy they aa base mustang V6V4  This car is a great value and Ford did a wonderful job merging classic design into a modern worldI get around 20mpg 18 if I rod around in the city and up to 26 on the hwyI think that the dark blue version is the best color and while my car has a grey interior and black top I think that the best color combo is the dk blue with tan interiortopNevertheless I get comments on my car all the time  this car is great for meeting peopleLOLI upgraded the lousy tires that Ford ships with the car  I went from being able to take a 45 mph corner at 55 to 80If you test one and question its performance I would suggest checking on the tires      First  let my inform you readers Im very car knowlegeable I am quite skilled in the field of automotive engines and electronics I deal with driveability issues every day Having said that this is my first Ford in 17 years Its my middleagecrisis toy Im a guy who has owned scores of GM vehicles  some good and some lousy I went with Ford this time because this is a company that doesnt appear to do alot of the dumb engineering things I have witnessed lately on either GM or Mopar Having said all that lets talk about the car itselfI purchased this winter with only 4300 miles on it I now have over 16000 miles on it after a few long distance trips the last couple months   Been an import guy for 20 years but decided to upgrade to the new Mustang Its roomier without feeling like a boat better on gas milage than some imports and built rock solid Great commuter  Recently purchased a used 2011 Mustang Convertible w 22kLike the look but extremely unhappy with the quality of some interior parts as well as the Ford 336 Bumper to Bumper warrantyFirst thing wrong is my 6way power drivers seat makes a terrible noise and moves very slow to not at all at times and Ford says that because it still works they will not replace it so play with it until it goes outHas an engine or tranny hesitation then the radio buttons on the steering wheel have the paint chipping off and the tan convertible top shows the black grease everytime you put it downI am no kid and am not hard on my baby but very disappointed in the car and Ford  I had a chance to buy one of the last new original 1973 Mustang convertibles back in 1974 and I made the mistake of letting my Dad talk me out of itIt wasnt until 2007 that I decided it was time for a convertibleIve owned 7 Fords since 1986 and have never had a single problem where the car had to go back to the dealer so I was confident on qualityI special ordered a redfire metallic premium V6 Pony convertible with auto transmission satellite radio and everything I could getAnd I couldnt be happierIts very tight quiet and a blast to driveIve added sequential turn signals and its a real headturner   This is my first car i got it in July 2011 for 14k a pretty good deal for my dream car The v6 is slightly underpowered compared to the Challenger and Camaro v6 but it is also much lighter actually beating both the challenger and camaro its a chick magnet and its fun to see their face when you put the top down  Overall its a blast to drive and ill remember my first car for the rest of my life I payed for it myself my father was willing to give me the extra 3k for a malibu since i live in Traverse City MI where winters are bad I got the Mustang anyways and have been extremely happy with our decision i definitely recommend this car the engine sounds amazing too fun fun car  This is my first Mustang first convertible and first V6 I really wanted a convertible and it really is great You actually feel good sitting in and driving the car and it is spunky enough for a sports carReally enjoyable the interior is really pretty all leatherMy 8 year old girl iis overjoyed and myself being 50 I really have a great time driving it with or without the top down Used to have a 5 liter Capri back in the 80s and although that had a lot more power this newer Mustang is much more comfortable to drive Gas mileage for this V6 is pretty good Beate Frederick MD  I bought this car on 12142011 Ive only driven it for over month it is my daily driver It has only 19000 miles on it and it is absoutely stunning I love everything about this car The way the engine rumbles the noise of the blinkers the sound of the door when you shut it the stero is kickin the ease at which the top goes up and down I have learned that you actually have to be careful in slower traffic because when you step on the gasyou get an instant response And yes I have raced it I have smoked everyone that I have come up against  in town and highway  with barely any effort This car was made to go fast And is excellent therapy if you have a stressful day at work  OkFirst Im a Corvette fanSo when my partner bought a 2011 Mustang Gt Convertible Auto I thought I would not like it but that I would just have to be supportiveBut to my surpriseI love this carI have a 2005 Vette Convertible and I would much rather take the Mustang on a trip than the VetteI knowI cant believe it but its the truthThis car is comfortable fast will take a curve like nobodys bussiness and looks pretty good doing it tooIf your thinking about one Get itYou wont be sorry maybe surprised like me  I have always wanted a convertible and could never find one I really likedI recently started test driving the Pontiac G6 and Chrysler Sebringthey could not even compare to how the mustang convertible droveI love my car black body black top and black interiorIt is so sleek looking and when I drive by with the top down people just stop and stareSuper fun car to drive and I fit my friends in there perfectlyDefinitely recommend  Its motor 46 is smaller than dads old 289 cu in with the 2 bbl carburetorAnd its an electric Grabber Blue color wblack cloth top  which always looks better when not sitting on a car lotI keep it garaged and only drive it on nice daysLoads of looks and compliments on the streetIts actually an automatic not offered in Model review selection info by Edmunds and it works perfectly for a vehicle made in summer of 2009Wife gave it to me as a 25th anniversary presentIt surprising how nice this vehicle is and the sound it makes is just rightNo tickets anddrive it with traction control activatedAn ounce of Image is worth a pound of performance  Ive had my Mustang for a week and I love itIt has fantastic giddyup pretty good mileage and it looks better than anything else on the roadThe engine is swift and responsive the SelectShift transmission is smooth and Im enjoying the Electronics package with Sync Navigation and entertainment options  Ive owned this car for a couple of weeks now and 700 miesSo this is a first impression with 700 miles on the odometerThe 50 convertible puts a smile on my face every time we go for a rideI love the retro styling old enough to have seen it the first time and the exahuast note with the top downJust took the first leg of a 140 mile trip and it performed flawlesslyIt is a base model GT convertible with M6 and 301A tech package which includes SYNCFor the trip with a little preplanning we managed to get everthing in the trunk for a 4 day trip wife and myself including a small coolerWould I buy it againYes  I got my 2013 GT Premium Convertible and have been surprised at how much I really like itI have never really been a fan of the newer 1980 forward Mustang designs until I saw this oneThe new front and rear design is greatThe car turns and handles well even with the solid rear axle but not as well as the Mazda MX5 which I upgraded fromThe 50 V8 is powerful and responsive with the 6 speed manual and when you stomp on the pedal it always brings a smileThe upgraded Brembo brakes help a bunch and although you can feel that the car is heavy it still is a load of fun to drivePlus the car turns a lot of heads   I recently bought a 2010 Mustang Convertible base V6 automaticWhat an awesome ride It has more than enough power to get me into trouble and is an absolute beautyThe lines are amazingId recommend it to anyone  ive had the car for almost 2 years and have had 3 engines in it Driver window fail fuel pump failed CD player failed and the transmission has small leak i love the car dont really plan on ever selling but its not recommended for a daily driver its not very reliable but its 10 years oldBut for a fun top down weekend warrior its great and its idea for customizationI know more than 10 people with the same style mustang GT and they have problems too but still love them if you buy one I recommend having 23k set aside for future repairs MPG isnt great either I average 15MPG combinedBut it works for me becauseI only drive the car maybe once a month  Alread forgot my bmw 1 series convertible Enter the mustang gt convertible premiumThis car is jam packed with valueThe car has great ergonomics the sync system works flawlessly the engine is a beast of beasts and shocked me with its pure power and torqueI expected the interior of car to be cheaply madeBut to my surprise the car is beautifully appointed and laid out smartlyNot cheaply done at allThe shaker stereo rocksCrisp highs and nice lows with no distortionBluetooth is amazing works great with the top down and wind blowing at 60 mphCar handles great and has a great bite on the road No doubt you get more car then a bmw and save over 10kIts a no brainer  I have a convertible and like it but I feel the price for the V6 Premium was about 5K too much and I bought it usedI have only had it three weeks and was a victim of a nasty hit and run while I was in a store so it sits in the shopIt will be interesting how it will hold up after being repairedMy girlfrield loves taking it on tight curves so I think this will be more her favorite car than mineI miss my 2011 Fusion SELMuch better bang for the buck  If youd be upset with a creaky front end having to return to the dealer a few times in the first 1015K miles for warranty work front end bushings and a potential wheel bearing failure then this is not the car for youWith all of that said the style and performance far outweighs any squeaks creaks rattles or noises plus the fact that its under warranty until 36KI will most likely be trading this in for a 50th Anniversary edition of the same model not only because I am sure Ill want one but also because if Im having bushing trouble and a fairly loud wheel bearing noise at 15K milesI cant imagine that the longterm reliability is good   Ive been driving my Mustang for about six months now and I have yet to be disappointed The V6 engine really has a suprising amount of punch and I simply love the way the Sync system works The mileage has been as promised and no warranty issues that need to be fixed I think a review has a better impact if it has some criticism but I really dont have anything to criticizeI especially like the entire lighting packagebright exterior customizable interior If you are thinking about buying a Mustangdrive it at nightits an entirely different experience  Ive always wondered how people come to hate a car company Ford usually being top of the list of most hated Now I know First theres a problem with the pedal assembly that prevented the driver from being able to depress the clutch properly and shift the transmission Car is out of warranty by 1000 miles and a few months its going to cost xxx More recently the interior is literally falling apart the pleather insert on the door panels is peeling off Car has 38k miles nothing we can do outside of the warranty itll cost xxx Even called Fords customer service line same response Well be selling this as we dont want to be on the hook for even bigger costlier problems later  I bought the 2011 v6 Mustang coupe due to the many refinements and was very happy with it but I had bought the base model and was wanting a convertibleThere was enough refinements in looks and performance as well as features that got me to trade in my 2011 for a 2013 This is the first time I have ever owned a convertible so it is a new experience for me I think everyone should own a convertible at least once in their lifeI got the premium auto with pony package all leather and sync The drive is much better than the 2011 and the looks are more masculine on the 2013 than the 2011 Even with the V6 there is enough power to do what you want  I just recently bought a 2000 White Mustang Convertible I have the automatic version and have not regretted it since I bought it The gas mileage isnt greatI only get about 300km on each tank but its so worth it This car is fun to drive especially when you put the top down and hear that engine Its powerful and turns heads Mine has the leather and suede interior which is a nice feature as all leather can get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter Only complaint would be the brakes squeal a bitits easily fixed with brake cleaner but Ive heard is a common issue with this year and model Either way Id fully recommend this car So fun to drive and good looking   V8 Engine smooth and fast Car looks great but when I hand wash or it rains water gets in door sills trunk wells hood leaks out of plastic around fog lights and rear lights front and rear bumper crevices After 50 years youd think Ford would have learned how to build this car tighter At a Sticker Price with tax of over 50000 they need  Ive had experience driving all sorts of vehicles and I can say without a doubt that my 2002 Ford Mustang GT is among the best of the best in almost all categories For starters its a Mustang an American icon Now take that image add 260 stock horsepower and youve got a beast of a carNot only is it powerful it gets surprisingly great mileage mine is getting roughly 26 mpg highway The thing is also built like a tank I havent had any mechanical issues other than routine maintenance The only issues are low seating capacity and cargo room but hey you dont get a Mustang in place of an SUV do you  Wow  Driving a 2014 V6 Convertible around Central Florida is FUN  There are compromises  V6 for regular gas automatic tranny more practical when I4 is a parking lot BUT  this car hugs the road loves curves accelerates  brakes smoothly I enjoy the handling as much as my wife appreciates the smooth ride Still learning to use the SYNC but Im getting there  Great carhad mine for 6 years bought it when it had a little over 100k needless to say i added another 150 k on it Engine is extremely reliable as long as you maintain regular oil changes Only bad side of this car is weather be very careful in the rain and snow do not drive over 30 miles an hour in the rain and park it when it snows   After previously having a total of 9 Camaros and Firebirds I finally defected from GM to Ford and bought this Mustang and I gotta tell you its pretty awesome And after coming straight from a problemplagued technologicaloverkillonwheels BMW 335i this car is quite a breath of fresh air by comparison Sure its a bit cruder in some spots but at the end of the day theres nothing like an allAmerican convertible icon with a honking V8 engine and retro style and attitude that this car has in spades  i bought my first 97 and on the way home with it a fool ran a stop sign at about 50mph and t boned me i woke up to smoke from the aiar bags but i was alive i hurt my neck a bit from the air bag impact but i was fine i went ahead and ordered me another one with 17 miles on it i got the sports appearance package the mach 460 sound system SWEET and an alarm system with a motion sensor the company statement was if my baby was stolen and i still had the two fobs they would give me 5k i still have it and at 113k it still runs great ive replace the suspension system but can still take those turns at 60mph easy  I had a new car and had so many problems Hard to work and picture it being a throw away car like some I decided to go backwards to a 2002 V6 that reminds me more of the days aperson could work on a carHAHAHAThere are some people who have these cars and they are over 200000 milesWhen you buy something at this age remember it may need a couple things Dont gripe about it Do your homework Some people beat the Hell out of them I happen to get mine from an older man in his 60s who took care of it  Ive had my 2012 base V6 convertible auto a few monthsIt was a rental and has just under 50000 milesMy first MustangIt is certainly behind in design compared with European sports carsespecially the base modelbut the appeal of the Mustang is in some ways its simple raw charismanot its bling The new V6 has awesome acceleration and can match the old V8 in terms of performanceThe stock auto setup is a compromise thoughFor general driving the Mustang is sweetWhen you want to unleash the beastthere is throttle lag and imprecise gear shifts until you get above 3500 rpmthen she pulls like a train   I drove the Challenger Camaro and MustangThe Dodge was a slug and the Camaro drove well but felt excessively claustrophobic and its lines never sang to me as did the stangI was hooked After 25000 miles in my Sterling Gray 50 GT with 6 speed manual I still REALLY enjoy driving itEvery time I get in it after a couple of days away its like an eager puppy that wants to go out and romp  with 412 HPGreat bang for the buck  There she was  50 vert with a 6 speed loaded white with a black roof and interiorThe car is very spritely almost go kart like especially after trading in a Hemi Challenger She rides on rails stops on a dime and is jack rabbit quick The interior fit me better than the SS and sight lines are better in the GT The interior its comfortable  ergonomic Its not gadgety or gimmicky The GT is more suited to a 50 year old than the SS Wrap up  For me its a great choice with no regrets Enjoy the ride  Got my wife an Ingot Silver 14 Mustang convertible a few weeks ago to replace her aging TaurusNothing but smiles every time she talks about itWeather permitting she drives everywhere with the top down and enjoys the comments she gets about her carIt is quick and smooth and the miles just melt away when going on road trips with the sun shining and the top downHands down the most FUN car in thirty plus years of buying cars togetherLow front end caught her a few days ago when she pulled into a parking spot and drove the front end up onto a curb popping a bunch of things loose in the front endminimum of 1050 to repair but still waiting to get it back and see the full bill   I love my little Mustang Its not powerful V6 but its an original with 17500 miles I bought new at our local Ford dealer here in Sarasota FL \r  It still gets tons of compliments every time I have it out  This is an update  I unfortunately had to sell my 2017  Became too hard to get out of  I loved it in every other way but was hurting my joints the bucket seat is so deep and low  I got a 2017 Honda CRV Touring new 1 class rating and I love it  Its not a convertible but has a sunroof All in all I really like it and my Aunt and Uncle liked it so well for the same reasons they traded in their Lincoln Town Car and bought a new CRV the same as mine top of the line Apparently they liked it Haha PS  I got 24K for my 7 month old Mustang paid 42K for it  Terrible depreciation  43 KBB by owner price  27K which still stinks Be forewarned they allow NOTHING for all those extra whistles and bells I expect the Honda to really hold value  Still was worth the taking the beating to feel and walk betterOriginal reviews follow I had a white convertible medium stone interior since I live at a warm beach  This is an update since I sold it to an 83 year old gentleman who is having the time of his life with it  50K miles with only one AC issue so far I retired from work in Alaska so I wanted all the fresh air and sunshine I could get to make up for all the time spent indoors up in the land of the great outdoors like most everyone I knew  This car fills the bill  Road trips are minimal in Alaska but after 30 years of travel commuting I am staying home except for a trip to Atlanta last summer However I plan to go to Seattle to see my son next Spring and maybe more trips after that For that and other reasons I bought a brand new 2017 Mustang convertible Mainly this is due to all the new accident avoidance technology  Decided on the Ecoboost and I couldnt be happier   I got the Ecoboost without the performance package for a smoother ride but all electronics for 42K Straight line acceleration above usable for merging isnt most important at my age but I did take it up smoothly to the electroniclimited 121 mph once The rear diffuser makes it hug the road even more at high speed Gets up to 32 mpg on highway It is a wonderful car  Even my BMW friends are jealous The open top is the main thing and the GT noise would block out the birds singing  But if someone doesnt have the money to buy a new one I recommend the 2014 highly  Lots of fun for the money It got me to the beach for my every morning walk with the early rays of sun on the water and along the waterfront under the stars at night  My older friend is still loving it and he brags to whoever will listen  This is an update and he still loves that 2014  He has the old fashioned class with sports jacket and roadster cap and is a cool old man  Like the Shelby Mustangs from 19681970 this new one is an odd contradiction Both brutally powerful in 435hp GT form and luxurious at the same time it recalls those late 60s boulevard cruisers more than it reminds me of the more simple honest 50 liter GTs of the 80s or the straightforward 2005 retro reboot \r That is ok as my 2015 GT Convertible finds me in my mid40s ready for a little more refinement in my car This is my 19th Mustang my tastes have changed and the car has grown up along with me\r This car is built like an anvil and full of modern conveniences It seems low and heavy at first but soon it shrinks around you and feels like an old pair of Levis  \r      took delivery of this few days back It is everything I liked about previous versions PLUS stuff that I had wished for  like the feeling of luxury without compromizing the sportyness Its pure exhilaration as this beauty accelerates like a wild one by the looks yet a seasoned tamed pony by the responsiveness  \r   Ive had my eye on Mustangs for years and now finally bought my dream car and not disappointed  It exceeds every expectation  LOVE THIS CAR\r Its got enough umph but also enough gas mileage averaging 24  Just the right balance  Best thing about this car is that its super goodlooking and just downright FUN FUN FUN to drive  \r You cant go wrong  Its not perfect in every way but still headoverheals in love with this car  Oh and did I mention that I love this car\r  I have had my new Mustang Convertible almost three months It was delivered without the protective Tonneau Covers which fit over the large holes in the frame when the convertible top is in the low position Calls and emails to the dealer asking about this important OEM part which protecets the convertible assembly from weather elements and debris while the top is down have gone unanswered The dealer doesnt have a clue when they will be available and delivered How could Ford deliver a brand new car with missing OEM parts Calls to Ford Consumer Marketing also do not get any help They simply say they are aware of the problem  Bought first week in 2009 Been a great toy car Never had any serious problems When back to the dealer for a loose drivers mirror and a buzzing noise in the transmission which I fixed myself a loose trans inspection plate Some performance and handling mods have been done but its basically all stock  We have put 24000 miles on our 2013 mustang\rIt has really exceeded our expectations The tires are barely worn I just rotated them It feels like it is glued to the road in turns It is heavy and powerful a 37 liter that gets 21 miles to the gallon in city driving Everything works perfectly I dont care for the bluetooth cell phone though too wierd but thats me It is perfect for two people a beautiful car that turns heads 80 feels like 60 mph 100 like 80 so you have to watch the speedometer\r I am generally pretty cynical about cars but I would recommend this car to anyone that has a little fun money and wants to jazz up their day   Fords complete indifference to customer satisfaction and its insistence in producing an unreliable product has ruined yet another potentially worldclass car This car is a blast to drive but the abysmal quality is surpassed only by the arrogance of its dealers In the first 5 months of ownership I have had the following issues\r Rumbling and vibration between 50  70 mph Drive shaft replaced at 1100 miles\rAC not cooling properlyblower fan surges\rRadio malfunctioned 3 times replaced once\rWindshield wipers malfunctioned\rBoth front seatbacks have mechanical issues\rThe amount of Convertible cowl shake has gone from acceptable to wet noodle in only 6000 miles   I have owned and driven a lot of cars over the years but this is  the one    I have always been a Mustang fan and this 2014 model is as close to perfect for me as I could get I purchased this convertible with 32000 miles on it and have since put about 20000 miles on it It is very difficult for me to let it stand still in the garage I love driving this car so much I have driven a pick up an economy car luxury car and German sports car and the Mustang is the best road handling of the bunch The acceleration is incredible the braking is strong and the fuel economy averages about 2324 in town Driving with the top down brings you much closer to nature especially living in a place like Central Florida It can get super hot outside but it is difficult or me to not want to put the top down This car definitely draws the looks of passers by and the admiration of others who have not realized their dream of Mustang ownership So far I have not had any mechanical issues to attend to I purchased a Ford Factory Extended Warranty and so far it has gone unused  Have had the car for 3 weeks already been in the shop 5 dayIt has a pulsating vibration between 60 and 75horrible and feels unsafe to driveReplaced driveshaft and rear differential on a car with barely 1000 miles and still not fixedLemon law is next if its not resolved ASAP  This droptop has been sold much fun to drive its an adult version of a gocart The bright red and excellent overall condition gets looks and comments It has 104000 milesstill runs strong and the car is still a sharp looking rideAuto Anything has provided some nice after market items such as new headligh assemblies Ill drive this car til it dies and enjoy every mile  My kids have gotten a little older so I got my 4th Mustang after a 10 year break I picked up a used black GT convertible for a VERY reasonable price and couldnt be happier so far You really cant beat all you can get out of this car for a VERY affordable price I got mine for under 15K in perfect condition and under 60K miles I get more positive comments while out and about than cars I have owned that cost 35K plusSure this car has its drawbacks such as a rough ride no storage space clunky shifting etc I am assuming people who want a refined car with good manners dont want a Mustang this is a good old fashion V8 rear wheel drive muscle car You buy it for fun and it deliversEdmunds asked me to update so here it is Two years later and I still love this car I have logged about 25K miles bringing the total to about 75K I have only had to replace the battery since nothing else This has been a fun reliable car that despite being 10 years old still draws attention and positive comments everywhere I go  The 2015 Mustang GT is finally a sports car The removal of the solid rear axle was the best thing they could have done The rear end hop has been eliminated which has taken a drag racer and made it into a touring car The stock ride is surprisingly comfortable for the driver and passinger Both have heated and air conditioned seats the driver has lumbar support and I dont know why they didnt put one in the passinger seat As always the back seat is more of an ornament than anything else Child seats or a few grocery bags is really all that youll be able to use them for The power and sound is great for a stock car but Id like the exhaust to be just a bit louder The headlights and signals are top notch I have the adaptive cruise control system and its been problematic The automatic windshield wipers will suddenly come on for no reason and the adaptive cruise control shuts down in heavy rain and ocasionally for no reason at all It claims the sensor is blocked The remedy is to pull over and restart the car The adaptive cruise control is operated by a radar head mounted below the grill and it also serves as a colision warning system It beeps and puts a red bar on the windshield Having that shut down during a rain storm is not something you want to happenThe interior far exceeds previous standards and it isnt a plastic rattle trap that weve come to know and love It has plush parts now and real metal The navagation screen is sharp and large enough to read The home screen can be reconfigured with personal wallpapers of anything you want Unfortunately the leather on the passinger side dash started to bubble on the inside front corner Ford had to replace the entire dashboard and the replacement dash has done the same thing Two dashboards before the first scheduled oil change is a bit muchThe car handles well even in normal touring mode There are 3 steering modes and as far as I can tell they just decide how much power steering you have By putting the pedal to the floor the tachometer gage will turn red at night when you touch the red line I havent used the line lock feature and probably wont New tires are expensive The car comes standard with W rated tires and I personally feel that they should change that to the Y performance rating The car is very responsive and I have broken traction once on a tight curve When these tires wear out I will be replacing them with a Y rated tire if for nothing else better tractionThe convertible top has an insulation layer that reduces road noise and makes for a quiet ride I can recommend this car over the Camaro and Challenger The Camaro has 12 more letters but you only gain 20HP  The Camaro isnt as comfortable to ride in and has less features UPDATE I have had a total of 3 dashboards and have been informed by Ford Motor Company that it is normal for the windshield wipers to come on without warning while in automatic mode When I pointed out to the dealership that my wifes Lincoln Navigator L has the same system and has never had any problem and I never had any such problem with my Mercedes that I traded in for the Mustang They told me that this is a Ford not a Mercedes I pointed out that the sticker on this Ford was over 500000 higher than the 2013 Mercedes SLK that I traded in on the car If Ford wants to charge premium prices they need to deliver premium goods I will be getting new tires for the car soon  All these cars have a problem with the AC compressor Ford should recall on this part because is a problem with all the 2010 mustang and is very expensive  Finally the new GT lives up to its reputation and becomes an adult within the global community of entry level super cars The lines and styling are on par with any high end European vehicle yet retains the Detroit muscle look at second glance The interior is no different the word luxurious for an automobile that usually cries out 20 year old kid with a wrench can be used legitimately Controls are ergonomic easy to reach and have a high quality flar The front seats fit like an Italian glove and make high speed cornering slip past with little notice Shaker system needs no further explaining nice The suspension is surprisingly nimble for a heavier car planted but not jarring The IRS is a welcomed addition and long overdue An engine that not only makes short work of highway miles is rev happy willing to grunt out any twisties that youd be more than interested in finding and finding often The 6 speed manual is light crisp and not a chore Reverse issues have been resolved and the added backup camera easily makes one feel in charge in tight situations I cannot fault this new generation of Mustangs other than a few more gallon capacity tank could provide more time carving up pavementbut then againpulling up to a crowded gas station  The smiles and nods of adoration warms the owners decision for their purchase  Just bought the 2016 v6 Convertable Mustang drove it home went to park the car in my garage and I heard a clunk noise in the rear of the car  Wow you can hear it every time you stop the car even at 1 mile per hour  It takes the luster off your new car purchase  Im headed back to the dealer tomorrow morning I hope to get it fixed or get a replacement  It is very fustrating went are so excited about your purchase and it disappoints you  OK just a quick update from my previous reviewSo the dealer found the cause of the rear end noise it was Lungnuts rolling around where the spare tire would be if there was one The car has locking lungs on it so someone put the spare lungnuts in trunk  Boy was I releaved It has been a week since I purchased the Mustang and I have to say It is my Dream Car  It drives great  handles amazingly well  It was warm enough to put the top downwhat a great day cruzing  This car is perfect for my life but not a family car The interior fits like a glove and the back seats are somewhat functional for small people Car has excellent take off and control its a blast to drive I LOVE this car Still going great   Ford finally put quality into the 15 Stang  This sexy eye catcher is a great summer ride Rides and handles like a dream and is extremely comfortable My only complaint is the poor grip on wet and almost dangerous on snowy roads even with their std All Weather Eagle GTs  Not for the faint of heart A red convertible mustang even ten years old now still draws quite the attention Mine is a cop magnet whenever I even consider revving the engine I know they are waiting around the corner for the next youngster in a red car By todays standards a 200 horsepower pony car is by no means american muscle but nothing beats hitting interstate speeds in under 6 seconds with the top downPros the ride is amazing Im used to riding bikes and being able to feel the road Last year I made a deal with a guy he was putting radials on his new gt and sold me his brandnew 2013 gt rims and his Perrelinerozeros for 300 bucks Thus I have a nicer car then 95 of the people in town Its a source of freedom and pride haha But when I park somewhere everybody knows its me Black leather interior black roof the fancy vinylish kind not the cloth top and of course the exclusive red sally paint jobCons The air conditioning can barely keep up with the heat of two passengers on a hot sunny day 105 degrees but thats to be expected with a black topped car Also the engine is limited in fourth gear Ruins my fun But then again theres no need to even be in fourth gear under 85 miles per hour  Top down fun that is worry free Proven V6 engine with automatic is a solid Ford drivetrain Back seat is for children and packages not adults Trunk is small to accommodate the convertible top Head turning and sporty  I had a 69 Mustang Mach 1 428 Cobra Jet This 6 cylinder 306 hp will out perform the big assed Mach 1 I had a racing Corvette pull out in front of me on a deserted state highway I either locked up the brakes or pass him I chose the latter I passed him at 120 and was still accelerating I looked over and his mouth was open It was worth the risk of a major ticket I still get around 27 to 29 MPG while having fun It was used and I got it for 13500 A sweet ride at any price  Great car  Enjoyable toy  I have owned my 2016 GT Premium California Special convertible Oxford White for 6 months now and every day I just look forward to driving itespecially with the top down  It has the 6 speed automatic with 355 LS Rear Axle Nav Adaptive Cruise Control Reverse Sensing Safety systemwell everything except the Performance Package which you cant get with the automatic transmission   Acceleration is awesome  Simply put it looks GREAT drives GREAT and sounds GREAT  No problems or regrets so farThis is the first vehicle built by an American manufacturer that I have purchased since 1985  Toyota and Honda and a number of Mazda Mx5s have been and still are in my driveway however I love this Mustang  Funny storyI rented a 2016 Ford Expedition for a week and was soo impressed with the quality and performance of the big Ford I had to go drive the new Pony Car  Word of advice  Dont test drive one if you dont want to own one  This is a 1 year UPDATE to the original review of my Mustang GTCS Premium ConvertibleÂ  Simply put I love it as much as the day I bought itÂ  It is my recreational sunny day driver so most of the 6500 miles are top down at the beach or open country roads or Blue Ridge ParkwayÂ  People still want to get a closer look at it or ask about it when I stop for gas or at a stop lightÂ  It is everything I expected it to beLooks GREAT sounds awesome handles like a sports car and takes off like a jetÂ  Top quality and no issues or concerns after a year and a halfÂ  GREAT CAR  I purchased a performance package GT convertible in January The exterior body panels were not bonded correctly by the roller at the factory causing noticeable creases at the edges of the trunk passenger door and hood The car has been reviewed by the dealer and 2 body shops and all agree this is a factory defect Problem is that FORD CORPORATE says it is NOT their problem Dealer is working with me to correct the poor workmanship but I am concerned that after the trunk door and hood panels are all reworked and repainted that the value of the car will be depreciated FORD should just take this car back and give me the straight car I paid 44k for  Great car Sold it and it went to South Carolina                                    SOLD THE CAR  A lot of car for the money  You can have three of these compared to the price of one Mercedes SL I had three SLs and do not miss them one bit  Especially the repair bills  Everything was 120000 minimum The Mustang is a a fun and iconic  muscle car for a lot of value for your  With more affordable matinence Love it  If youre looking for a commuter car to take the kids to soccer practice this isnt the car for you It doesnt turn on a dime it doesnt have a lot of trunk space and if youre looking for lots of places to store maps and sunglasses and purses andor man bags this also is not the car for you I didnt want any of the things I mentioned I wanted a convertible with a big V8 a nice loud engine a comfortable front seat and a top that didnt take an engineering degree to put down I got all of that and more with my 2015 mustang gt premium convertible with automatic transmission Manual transmission was not an option as I am somewhat handicapped but who cares  I put the accelerator to the floor and my mustang jumps ahead of traffic with a nice growl of the engine and pushes you back into the seat The interior looks great More leather and less plastic than the 2014 model The audio system is amazing and rumbles just as loud as the engine Putting the top down is quick and easy Ive had the car for about a month and I get compliments at the intersection as well as the parking lot at the grocery store Its a pleasure to drive and I couldnt be happier I had a 1983 mustang gt convertible years ago but there is no comparison Before you get to critical try driving the new GT    Ford informed all Mustang and potentially other makes and models owners in June 2015 that the airbags need to be replaced Since I have been calling to see where they are at on this situation as I do not want my children in the car let alone myself where the very function that is supposed to help you in an accident could result in serious injury or death as stated directly in the 2nd recall letter I received last week I called Fords service division to discuss what they will be doing for their customers and they said nothing but simply having us wait another 6 months for the part to slowly come in As the service lady stated on the phone to me I think this is very irresponsible on Fords part Having their customers drive around a car that could put them at greater risk in an accident than the very accident itself I feel it is unfair as a customer to be forced to drive under these conditions or choose to sell or leave the car in the garage knowing the risks of driving it Ford should allow customers who bought cars to return them or provide us with safer vehicles in the meantime until these issues are fixed  My car has relatively low mileage for an 08 and a new top  It looks great on the street or parked  I have to be good on the road or I getmarked because the car looks like trouble brewing  It can rumble in a purring way or take off when the path is clear  Either way it has always been fun to drive especially with the top down  Only problem was the long wait to have the Takata airbag replaced Ford shouldhave been more supportive  I just took possession of a new 2016 Ford Mustang GT Ruby Red Convertible Yea The mighty Coyote V8 thunders and rumbles even when sitting at idle Everyone loves it It just oozes power and performance Its a trip Punch it and runs  At stops people can hear the powerful engine and they look over often giving a big thumbs up Cruising through town or just on the local boulevards the car catches eyes and ears  You just have to look and listen  Car is gutsy  Wow this car is sweet  Love the new look and I will tell you so does everyone else  I have people commenting all the time about what a beautiful convertible mustang I have  I admit I think I have the best possible color combination red with black premium leather  My vehicle is the 50th Anniversary Editionand boy is it nice  We have a new Cadillac suv and my husband thinks the seats are just as comfortable as that of the Cadillac and that says ALOTI had an older mustang convertible that I sold to purchase the anniversary model and I had no problem selling that eitherYou cant go wrong buying Ford and you certainly wont regret getting the mustang model  I cant say enough good things about what Ford did with the new design it looks and runs awesome  I get classic cars and that is what I like  Until I found my gt well I did some thing I would never do I traded my 1964 ford galxie 500 in great shape but I did find my mustang gt 2002  I thing is the best year I have found I looked at a lot of them and found the 2002 to be like a tank yes its built that good so I did find a classic and I like the idea of having the 289 ci I loved that motor when I was a kid could not kill that motor so I do not have a bad word to say I found the classic I was looking for to keep for many years thank you so much ford you out did yourself  Great auto hugely appreciated  Rides beautifully problem free none since its purchase in 2008 source of many inquiries such as to when are you going to sell it and remains the source of numerous complimentary comments    Update 82017     We have owned this car for a year and my husband still refers to her as his other love  She is better than any medication  Any time we feel bad or just need cheering up we take her for a quick drive with the top down and life is better  Car has held up well and we have had no problems  The climate control works beautifully  I had some doubts given the black leather interior but it stays fairly cool inside even on a hot summer day  Seat coolers help a lot  If we had it to do over we would definitely buy her againOur first Mustang was a 2004 GT convertible 40 automatic  Sassy was a fun little car not a lot of zip but a ton of fun and we cherished her for 12 years  Then we bought our new 2016 GT convertible with the California Special package  With Ruby it was love at first sight  If she were human she would sound like Mae West with that throaty growl  She handles and rides like a dream and that much horsepower should be illegal  We are a retired couple yet we feel like kids when we drive this car just for the sheer fun factor  We love her and plan on keeping her in the family for a long time  I just got my 2015 Ford Mustang Convertible v6 with red exterior and black interior The driving dynamics of this car are absolutely amazing It feels like a true sports car The drive is firm but smooth and when you put your foot on the gas the car just flies I remember when I was taking the car out of the dealer numerous people passing by were commenting how beautiful the car looks in bright red My only complaint is that the interior looks plasticy outdated and kind of cheap The materials are really mehhhwish they had done something to make it look more upscale but all I care about is how it drives and for that this car gets an A  Ive had this car as a rental for 8 days The ride is very smooth and supple There is some cowl shake at times but its mostly well controlled With the top up road noise is muted from the tires but noise comes through the windows easily  The ecoboost 4 cylinder is no where near 5961 in the convertible Best time I got was 69   It lacks any authority in acceleration and is a very poor choice The fuel ole age I got was 193 mpg   My 57 Hemi manual challenger gets that The seats are quite good as I have three bad discs and spinal stenosis and arthritis in my sacrum and these seats were a dream The stereo system leaves a lot to be desired My Boston acoustics in my challenger easily outperforms the shaker system I rented this car to see if I want to buy it I do but not this powertrain Do Im either left to v6 with no options allowed by fire or step up to the GT This powertrain is a joke  I used the Edmundscom price to buy the car through the ford dealership fleet sales manager It could not have been easier The car is one month old now and its a fun car to drive Just put the top down and go   I got the new platinum white color which I love because it has a nice pearl finish  It is FUNNNNN  Fun to drive  Do your research this is a car that dealers like to overprice due to it being eye candy for the dealer lot a great deal can be had all you need is persistence  Dont buy this car  Has been in the shop more times than I care to count  Love my Mustang Ecoboost Convertible  Power and acceleration is probably good for most people  But I wanted a bit more power for hills I drive  I was able to make some easy modifications to improve power  Next step is upgraded turbo  Looks great good visibility for a sports car and I find the convertible very enjoyable  Car drivers car  You can drive the 19992004 Mustang V6 convertible yearround in most parts of the country  Mine has been my daily driver since 2007 driven in Ohio and Tennessee  The heater works great in the winter  no different than in any other car  And as soon as the temps start to climb in the spring down goes the top   It is low to the ground so getting in and out of the drivers seat definitely isnt for people with stiff backs  Maintenance is pretty easy  the engine compartment is big enough to reach all of the spark plugs  In over 100000 miles Ive only replaced the clutch once 39 liter engine with T5 tranny and the top once roughly 1000  Love the car inside and out average fuel milage about 22 miles a gallon city driving Excellent acceleration and handles real well Sound system wonderful Fun car shouldnt get bored of this car First yaaay Second last yaay a href Some say Mat resides in that forest in between car reviews Carwow just park a new car in front of the treeline as bait and he emerges Oh yes How many more convertable reviews Will Matt respondGreat video as always I now want a boost bar for some odd reason Nice review 321st good video I don39t understand the mpg The higher is better  gay Yo matt I like the boost choc Easter egg Haha You39ve done the new BMW 7 Series review new Mercedes S Class review and the new Audi A8 review Any chance of doing the new Jaguar XJ How39s your Porsche going Fixed the roof All good Internet fixed ecoBoost bar matt why is it an auto manual only Hey Mat great work lol on the dolphin jokeQuestion though when are you doing the American muscle comparison now that Chevy Camaro is in UK Convertible Ecoboost Mustang That39s heresy Love the comment quotOK Ford I will raise the Windows thenquot brilliant REALLY UGLY EU Why do we get the Mustang with no LED running lights in the front and with larger side mirrors can39t afford one but his reviews feel like I m driving one This car interior quality is really bad This car is not a good one I think you need to make one longer video with all the space and practicality sections included It makes it easier than going backwards and forwards through videosJust my opinion Rather hav an M4 or C63 Finally an honest review of this car Before Mat says what engine he39s reviewing I39m guessing a 23l EcoBoostMy guess comes from the boost bars D Matt u going bareback Best reviews on YouTube you39re funny haha I hate convertibles that have more than 2 seats it39s just something about those rear seats that disgust me can u make all car cameras to record when u add storage and little software has any1 done it in terms of style it wins over a TT in spades my daughter has one in Texas or had one and it was impossible for a decent child seat Great little review as always cracked up at the headrest dolphin part  Hey Matt I love your reviews Really awesome jokes btw DCould you do one about the Mazda CX 5 I39d like to watch it from you with this new cool features on carwowKeep going like this and i39ll never unsubscribe this channelCheers When will America sort their shit out with interior material quality this looks like a cabin from 2004 citroen c3 wtf are you talking about matt looks like shit Great with the new 4 point system  avoid consider shortlist and buy FYI That is not a 2017 Mustang Very cheap and poor quality great looks overall meh reviews are becoming more entertaining keep up this work carwow it39s great seeing that lame quotnow what do i think of the quot outro replaced with the quotconsider it buy it thingquot Salty price for what you get in this I hope Matt didn39t run anyone over with that Mustang Matt said nothing about it sloppy steering feel when turning around corners Boooooost please make a video on audi rs5 It39s a ford  what did you expect Lol Matt looked like a quotspecial T rex getting in to the back seats  In the early 90s Ford done a mustang that has rear independent suspension  but the 39purists39  over in America hated it as it was slower on the drag strip They was that vocal Ford went back to the old live axel for a 20years Boost bar for EcoBoost  car wow Easter eggs I39d have to get the nonconvertible V8 You don39t buy a Mustang for economy  a href I guess it was bring your kids to work day eh Nice Easter egg Mat  The exposed wires going into the rearview mirror is an example of its poor quality I happen to own an EcoBoost convertible and I must disagree with all the criticism It39s very easy to dismiss the car simply because it doesn39t have the V8 but a V8 for daily use and commuting really doesn39t make much sense since I39m on a budget The only issue with the EcoBoost is the sound which I39m happy to give up for the improved fuel economy would only get the coupe model however if your not loaded the ecoboost would still be a good option if you don39t want to pay £500 tax and funny enough the Americans are all for the ecoboost over the v8 according to sales the whole point of a mustang is that you39re buying into the whole v8 American muscle car thing so a 4cl makes zero sense look at that product placement boost bars nice enough bloke Matt but the reviews are kind of irritating Any mazdas coming soon It39s so American it39s surprising a Big Mac holder isn39t on the options list Looks a bit more practicable than the previous generation in particular the boot openingSame shockingly poor build quality by the looks of things I remember taking the previous gen down the Pacific Coast Highway it was a brand new V6 but the wipers and air con both packed in after 1000 miles I don39t know why I felt like grabbing a boost bar looks cheap All the boost bars haha Eco boost  TKMaxx car That looks like a real crowd pleaser ive sat in the back of a supra feel my pain pls that head rest but made me LOL so much instant like Wow it can talk to dolphins Mat the way you enter the back seat is hilarious Just like how a raptor trying to get into it Can we get more videos pf your personal 911 Seeing a brit driving a mustang is like seeing a fellow yank drink a cup of tea It just seems odd The V6 is a way better option than the 4 and desppite what Ford says gas mileage should be around the same Starts from £35000 and it has manual seats and cheap plastic Ha I think I39ll stick to my 3 series and my X5 thanks I never know if the 39thumbs up or thumbs down39 is for the REVIEW or the CARso thumbs up for review thumbs down for car Interiour looks as cheap as  japanese cars in the 90s lol I still love the car I only come here to find out more about the roof of the porsche come on Mat spill the beans What an incredibly distorted review  I noted most reviews were for GTs  I own an Ecoboost Premium Convertible  Acceleration is soso  Handling is incredible  Only two complaints are the windows controls are too far forward and the antenna is awkward if you have a car cover but it unscrews solving that  Radio actually works fine without it screwed back in  The rear seats cannot be used for passengers but I knew that in buying it  They do make good interior storage  something the old Z3 I had was short of  Gas mileage is killer  I saw acceleration is soso only due to my last car a Lincoln LS with the V8 being no slouch so the Ecoboost doesnt seem to add anything to that  Compared to something else maybe itd be more impressive  So niggling complaints on what has proven to be an incredibly handling car with enough pop to satisfy  Comfort on long drives is much better than expected  the Z3 lacked in that department Review says car acquired in 2016 as page doesnt have 2017 as an option  car was new in August of 2017 I hope matt didn39t hit a crowd Our Matt loves a Boost THE AMERICANS STILL CAN39T MAKE A GOOD CAR bottom line is rubbish car haha gud review Matt a href  I liked the little Boost joke P Matt you love the focus but the mustang is rubbish  also the 23 engine is great in the focus but rubbish in the mustang  dude Wtf  if it39s not british it39s rubbish or what  another entertaining car review by Matt That39s not a 2017 model it39s SYNC 3 on 2017 cars not the SYNC 2 system fitted here I always knew mustang was a piece of shit Great job carwow I was watching Matts reviews since his previous channel and joined carwow from the beginning Guys you really get what it takes to make the show Keep it up Also you should do hot hatchbacks review and head to head Golf R Audi R3 Mercedes A45 AMG and BMW 1M Toyota Corolla has been in production since 1966 but you don39t see them bragging about it In the real world a new Corolla will probably outlast a Mustang looks absolutely ridiculous car LOL when you get into the rear of the car Mat it39s like you held your breath for quite long  safe to drive now after 2 years air bag replaced Took years to replace un safe air bags dealer until bags were replaced offered me next to nothing for it The first thing I did after car was fixed was to trade it off   Carwow Something I39ve noticed is that most American cars don39t pass the big bottle door test I think it39s because in America we don39t sell many beverages in 1 liter bottles the way they are well anywhere else in the world I think American car designers don39t have the liter bottle in mind when they make the door bin Just something I39ve noticed and something you might mention next time you review an American car I love your videos Keep it up Ecoboost zzzz 2 bars of boost  Wanted a newer mustang for quite a while  Found the perfect car for me  Right color deep impact blue convertible a lot of bells and whistles  Price was very good for a low mileage spotless car  Wanted a newer mustang for quite a while  Found the perfect car for me  Right color deep impact blue convertible a lot of bells and whistles  Price was very good for a low mileage spotless car Where could I save money on a new car   This is my first Mustang ever as well as my first convertible  I never had a family member to own one or a close friend  I had friends in high school that did but never rode in one  I rented this vehicle in August of this year and loved it from the start  The feeling of being in a convertible is like no other driving experience I have ever had  I also had never driven a V8 before either  It was a pure endorphinadrenaline rush During my car research I looked also looked at the Camaro 2SS while it was truly a great car it was just too expensive  Another deciding factor in choosing the Mustang was that I had watched A Faster Horse on Netflix  For those who havent watched the documentary it is a great film on how they designed and made the new 2015 model as well as how the original come to be  I just felt more of a connection to the Mustang and honestly Chevy had burned me before on a 98 Malibu I bought new  Biggest piece of crap I have ever owned  So it was an uphill battle for them anyway  So the car itselfbiggest pro to me is the look of the car  I just stare at it in my garage and when I walk up to it at the grocery store  It is a race red black top GT and it is gorgeous in my opinion  Some folks dont like the new design but I would not have considered this car without the new design  The other biggest pro is the power  Why you would buy an Ecoboost or a V6 in a Mustang is beyond me  Yes the gas mileage sucks but man that car rumbles and has sooooo much character that you just dont get in the other smaller engines  It makes me smile every time I push the start button  Finally the other pluses is all the technology in the car  This thing has got it allI wont list them here as you can check it out yourself but a hidden gem I found is that you can program your key so that the car wont go over a certain speed and the radio wont go over a certain level  It also tracks the miles put on the car with that key  So if I want my son who is 16 and gets giddy every time I let him drive it Im in the car with him to drive it without me at least it is the realm of a discussion to be considered  The biggest downside to this car is the ride  It is bumpy and I mean BUMPY  You feel every divot in the road  I know this isnt a luxury carI got that and I wasnt expecting a BMW cloud feeling but for the first time ever I got slightly car sick after a 5 hour drive to see my family for the holidays  We had to stop so I could get rid of the motion headache I had  So that is a big bummer  I feel that if they could have made the Normal mode just a bit smoother on the suspension that they would have a perfect car  Now I own it and I am sure I will get used to it  It does not diminish how I feel about the car overall  I love driving it around town but wont be taking it on any long trips without at least a half a Bonine in my system  I do look forward to taking it to the beachI meanits a convertiblethat is a requirement The gas mileage is what you would expect from a V8not very good  However I was getting 27mpg on the interstate with cruise control on but city is 18 to 19  A few other things to note before I close is that the feel of the steering wheel is great and adjustable with the steering mode  I keep it on Comfortable while driving around town but kick it back to sport when I want to push it  The SYNC system is great but I am still fighting the voice command a bit as she doesnt always understand me  A bit more work could go into that aspect of the software  The biggest thing here is that the car is just fun to drive  I didnt go for practical I went for fun and if you want a fun car get the Mustang GT and if you are feeling really spiritedmake it a convertible I39m disappointed with Ford and this in the US you can get this with the 50 V8 a bit softer than the fastback but it39s a proper V8 PD If this is a 2016 model why doesn39t carry a sync 3 system on it   Exceptional summer toy  I have the 6 speed auto with paddle shifters not the 6M  Also have the performance package with bigger brakes suspension and summer tires A second set of winter or all season tires is a must have because at below 40 degrees the Pirelli PZero summer tires are hazardous to your health  Recommend Pirelli PZero Neros   Acceleration is scary fast especially in the sport mode and drivability is exceptional Its heavier than its Camaro counterpart but much less skittish  Solid dependable easy and funto drive  This Mustang has all of the luxury touches that my Lincoln MKZ has backup camera heated and cooled leather seats navigation sound system dimming mirror memory seats and mirrors etc  With the top down its what youd expect with the top up its as quiet and luxurious as the Lincoln  The auto press consistently gives this car bad marks for a buzzy engine and its infotainment system while ignoring its value and dependability  IMHO they are wrong  If you are looking for this type of car you must consider it  lest you spend thousands more for a BMW Audi or Mercedes or wind up disappointed with a Camaro of Dodge  Drive it  you will be surprised read amazed12122017  Another great summer with the Mustang   Still turns heads after 3 years  No substantive change in my review other than gas mileage has improved somewhat to 24 mpg overall  Of interest  Netflix has a fascinating documentary about the development of the 2015 Mustang called A Faster Horse well worth your time I don39t understand why Ford doen39t give the customer the opportunity to choose higher quality if he doesn39t has a problem with spending more money The GT costs in germany around 50k they just could give things like leather packages etc for 10k extra I39d say a lot of ppl would compare this to a 440i S4 or CLA  Update I had to trade in this car on a new Honda CRV Touring  I just could not get out of it any more My joints were in rebellion so I am just too old 68 for this car with deep and low bucket seats  In fact when I showed the CRV to my Aunt and Uncle they went and traded in their Lincoln Town Car on the exact same thing My Aunt was able to get out with no effort at all with her bad knees That is the ONLY problem I had with using the 2017 Mustang but it was enough  It also depreciated heavily in 7 months from 42K to 24K KBB trade  That part is disgusting but you get nothing for all the addonsbeware Otherwise as my personal car it was the best car I ever owned for fun and for comfortable traveling while in it So read onOriginal review starts here  I loved my 2014 Mustang convertible read the review so I got a new 2017 to have all of the active safety features and other convenience tech What I got was something that is a huge step up in quality  In fact a different machine with the feel of the BMWs Mustang handles better in my opinion  test them I tested and a huge leap above a Camaro  It accelerates smoothly up to 121 mph where it is electronically limited gets up to 32 mpg on highway with super unleaded about 2930 with regular  Handles much better than the GT again try them out side by side  I did several times  GT feels front heavy and bulky This drives like a sports car nimble and quick fun And with a rear diffuser it hugs the road tighter at really higher speeds over 100 mph that I couldnt get near with the 2014 bc the front end would start feeling lighter and drifting Has plenty of storage something lacking in the old Mustang and nonexistent in Camaros  The only things lacking is automatic braking something I will demand in 3 years or I will switch models and lane warningassist  The forward collision warning is great but it just preloads brakes probably a nod to the general macho among Mustang owners but auto braking should be an option for those of us more concerned with being alive and the safety of others than imagined macho  Another after market add on is a windscreen which really makes a difference if you want to communicate or listen to the radio at highway speed  It makes your car a two seater when in place but I never have more than one lady friend at a time riding   Easy to remove but dont get this car for a backseat anyway  One small feature I love is the center console which locks when you hit the door lock fob  I leave the top down a lot when I go into a store This combined with alarms keeps stray hands out that stuff  All in all a wonderful car  After owning 6 convertibles and 4 of them Mustangs this is way far best embarrassing  Alan partridge drives this ford
