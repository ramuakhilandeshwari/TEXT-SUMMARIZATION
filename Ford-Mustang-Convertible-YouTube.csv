2021-04-20T12:09:28Z,do they make left hand drive mustangs ?
2021-04-13T03:42:50Z,A Mustang without a V8 ain't a Mustang as simple as that.
2021-03-31T08:35:45Z,BOOST
2021-03-30T17:03:35Z,How tall are you though
2021-03-05T04:53:48Z,He doesn't seem like he understands why people get convertibles. If we wanted a Mustang GT to whiz around a track and to drift in we wouldn't have bought a convertible. It's like reviewing a forklift and saying it would be better if could hold dirt like a dump truck.

2020-07-05T04:01:35Z,Ur so hot
2020-07-04T16:37:50Z,This guy is a mustang hater
2020-05-27T12:34:34Z,"Such a shame, looks decent, but i still prefer the late 60's models, same with the Corvettes, and we all know American build quality is poor, cheap plastics and poor fit and finish, obviously Americans don't care about that kind of stuff, they just want a noisy engine! Stick to European sports cars, at least they are built so much better."
2020-05-19T07:28:53Z,This car ass lol

2020-01-05T12:11:13Z,"This exact car costs 160000 British Pounds in my country with the taxes and excise duties  That's the tax for a mere 2.3 litres engine, and the taxes increase exponentially as you approach higher engine capacity, and there's a 800 percent tax on 5000cc Engines. :)

The country is Bangladesh."
2019-12-15T19:35:18Z,2016 model - not 2018

2019-09-30T16:50:20Z,Bro you‚Äôre getting a monster v8 muscle car for less than 40k and you‚Äôre going to complain about some plastic at the door? That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs less than 40k

2019-08-04T07:16:11Z,Why is a car that is ¬£35000 in the UK less than $35000 in the US?
2019-08-04T07:15:02Z,It's inexpensive. So why all the complaining about the cost-cutting features?
2019-07-06T18:45:48Z,Ford= found on road dead
2019-06-13T13:42:34Z,"I'm unsubing from this. So much bias towards coupes, 0 understanding of what a convertible actually is.

Roof loweres in under 12 seconds which is actually very, very fast.  

You get wind noise? NO SHIT SHERLOCK.

You need to slow down to put the top down?! Do you even understand the damage that can be done if you basically put what acts as a parachute at 50mph? 

Interior sucks? well don't get the most basic version of the car.

No room in the back? I sit in the front, why would I need the space in the back?!

Look dude, I've driven ONLY cabrio cars since my first car ever. We don't care about back leg room, we don't care how the bloody interior looks.

WE CARE ABOUT THE WIND NOISE AND THE ENGINE SOUND.

Does a biker care if he has no room in the back seat, or his windshield is made out of plastic - no.

Learn the target group for these cars and look at it from their perspective. Convertibles are a completely separate group of cars, and you can't compare them to coupes and limousines."
2019-06-13T13:36:19Z,"You know what - it's time for every reviewer to learn - YOU DON'T BUY A CONVERTIBLE TO BE THE FASTEST AND THE BEST AT CORNERING SO STOP JUDGING THE CAR BASED OFF OF THE COUPE - IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CAR. Bloody hell you people, do your homework."
2019-05-25T14:07:25Z,this is like a 2015 model lol why does it say 2018

2018-11-29T21:48:26Z,that is not a 2018 model
2018-11-21T04:57:43Z,"I don't know... I have a '17. Love it. Interior is very nice. I have a friend that has a ""loaded"" Mini. This is a head scratcher. Talk about cheap plastic! Maybe Mini is making the interiors on the Mustangs sent to the EU? The tip-off?: The steering wheel is on the wrong side for crying out loud!"
2018-11-08T11:57:35Z,"Europeans are such softies when it comes to interiors, always bitching about interior plastics as if they're connoisseurs of the stuff. As for the soft ride and poor visibility, it's a convertible for Allah's sake. And trunk space? What, really, do you expect? Look, buy the damn thing and you'll have more fun than you ever expected, and if you're single, you won't be for long."

2018-09-06T10:43:48Z,Matt you're a bit of a pratt.  IF you want to be a credible reviewer you need to be more impartial. AS you are there are way better people better than you. Your fired....
2018-08-30T00:00:21Z,"All the journos say go 5.0. Why?

Cos they get free fuel for the test drives and literally get off on anything with a V8 under the bonnet.

For the UK market it makes so much sense to go V8 especially with the amount of remaps out there"
2018-08-04T12:08:30Z,in algeria where i live they are selling the new mustang but only the convertible still didnt get into algeria

2018-07-12T23:03:44Z,"I like the car alot, but I couldn't drive the convertible, with the top down, without feeling really embarrassed."
2018-07-09T22:56:27Z,Better if come with hard top
2018-07-09T16:17:02Z,"I‚Äôm constantly annoyed by all car reviewers who all seem to judge every car by its inclusion or lack of a sporty nature. All cars have a mission; minivans=kid hauler, sedans=family car, convertibles=fun, etc.  Yes, a car can have multiple attributes, but every car will compromise those things that are outside of its primary purpose. I don‚Äôt expect a Porsche 911 GT2 to get the economy of a Ford Fiesta - that‚Äôs not its mission. 

As for the Mustang convertible, it‚Äôs a cruiser with sporty intentions - especially with the 4-banger. But at its price point, you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find something that offers the same fun per dollar which means there are compromises in materials, etc."
2018-07-05T15:00:01Z,"This car starts from 110, 000 Euros in the Netherlands.... nice eh?"
2018-07-02T02:15:26Z,I think Ford Mustangs only problem is they didn‚Äôt pay Matt enough to like it. I currently have this same car as a hire car and I think it‚Äôs great. Granted the roof catch is a little old school but otherwise I can‚Äôt fault it. Will be heading to the Ford dealer on my return for sure!
2018-06-29T22:05:41Z,Do you like this car? Remember the ford pinto? Said yes to both? Just wait till a cr....BANGGGGGGG....

2018-06-19T07:52:40Z,Yah we all can't afford V8's hey! So thanx Ford for making something amazing affordable like back in 64 when you made Mustang affordable to everybody.
2018-06-14T23:10:28Z,"Matt, why did you not do the review with a V8 car? Disappointing"
2018-06-10T15:16:05Z,I wanted a review of the 2018 model as in the description. This car has 2016 plates.
2018-05-26T20:50:03Z,Reviewed the wrong Mustang mate

2018-05-12T17:33:49Z,A Saab 93 convertible 175bhp would cost around the same as a Mustang back in 2003
2018-05-05T12:57:49Z,That boost candy though
2018-05-02T12:22:06Z,And.....it takes half that time to lower the roof. Dont exagerate.
2018-05-02T12:15:58Z,Under 6 seconds?  Just rented one in Arizona....  S and track mode and I got 7.9
2018-05-01T04:31:09Z,This is not a 2018....
2018-04-30T11:43:52Z,Why does it say 2018 Mustang in the title when this video is from 2016?
2018-04-29T05:10:41Z,this guy is kinda annoying with this terrible review.  trying to find every little thing to complain about.  it is a fuckin amazing car for the price.
2018-04-21T11:32:38Z,It sounds like you don&#39;t like this particular car and not the convertible as a whole

2018-04-16T03:39:39Z,Ford made a lot of upgrades to the interior and increased HP to 460 and added active exhaust and magnetic dampening shocks that this 2017 video misses  yes that is right - this review is on a 2017 model year not the much improved 2018 model year.
2018-04-13T22:49:28Z,"This is not the 2018 version, stop trying to click bait!"

2017-09-02T20:36:00Z,Planning on buying a used 2015 mustangv6 convertible are the convertibles good? I hear they are slower then the hard top??

2017-08-29T00:10:14Z,"Meh, this chap really does not understand this particular model. I completely disagree especially with the end, It should be a &quot;buy it.&quot; I am an owner of one and know how much fun this car is and how the four cylinder out performs all but the stoutest V8&#39;s out there while getting decent gas mileage. Home run Ford!!"
2017-08-27T01:35:25Z,It got a 2/5 star for safety in Australia...going 50-64 km your more likely to get serious chest injury compared to like a subaru...costing this much it should be much safer...so speed over safety?
2017-08-03T02:43:57Z,When your looking at a one bedroom condominium with Formica countertops and carpeting instead of solid wood floors you don&#39;t complain that it&#39;s not finished in higher cost materials because you&#39;re aware the price would be much higher. The gt model would be the condo with a great view and the four cylinder is in the back facing a brick wall. Both have carpet but you want the view. It&#39;s more exciting. <br><br>Forgot to mention. the marble countertops and Brazilian teak floors you want are down the street at the Porsche dealer. 
2017-08-02T22:07:51Z,"Definitely neat car and fun to drive and doesn&#39;t look like the other cars, and convertible is the way to go if you&#39;re in a warmer climate and the six does just fine although the V8 would be my pick."
2017-07-14T13:36:01Z,At that price we in India don&#39;t even get a Hyundai SantaFe
2017-07-03T19:15:05Z,What does this idiot expect? He sure knocks the car. My question: What does the UK or Europe for that matter make that would compare to this car in terms of price and what you get for the price?
2017-06-17T04:18:10Z,Love That Car
2017-05-06T13:38:40Z,"And if you buy this halo car for the Ford brand, you get the &quot;honour&quot; to drive around in the only car on the market, which Euro NCAP have scored only 2 stars in its crashtest in recent years. Its even worse than cars like the Fiat Doblo, which scored 3 stars. So well done Ford, great job.... Or something."
2017-05-01T12:41:36Z,the review shld have inproved the Sales but now after this review the Sales will drop further
2017-04-26T21:39:21Z,I love English people OMG You look like a forest gump Moron  Get GT next time

2017-03-20T11:56:06Z,"If  you get the optional colour interior, a lot of the hard plastics are upholstered.  Available in the  Premium only.  Extra $$$ of course."
2017-03-09T23:13:14Z,That roof latch looks identical to the one used on the late 90&#39;s CLK. Ridiculous that they went for that mechanism.
2017-02-27T15:14:11Z,I own this car and compared to my other car (2007 Honda Accord) it is amazing.  Looks and power (I drive the ecoboost in the sport mode almost all the time - something that wasn&#39;t mentioned in this vid) are incomparable to so many pedestrian type cars.  Why does every sassy sounding Brit reviewer keep comparing this to a V8 version which costs 5k more?  This is a somewhat affordable and goes quite fast compared to most of the cars you&#39;ll see on the road around you.  As fast as a Porsche?  No.  As slow as a camel? No.  It just &quot;is what it is&quot; and it is a really fun (and quite fast in sport mode) car.
2017-02-27T00:45:14Z,I think the only thing the british care about is plastic. i have never seen a review by a british person that don&#39;t bitch about plastic. it&#39;s getting old
2017-02-19T18:38:13Z,"Dear Great Britain , sorry the mustang is a compromise between luxury &amp; affordability. Sorry it&#39;s goal is to be a fun car and not a speed demon or a rolling leather couch. Please feel free to totally customize your mustang to suit your taste. That&#39;s why there is such an enormous aftermarket to support the mustang owner."
2017-02-17T22:29:13Z,You do know this is a sports car. Maybe you should stick to the family wagon
2017-02-12T06:35:32Z,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_6s-8Pagc&amp;t=1m28s"">1:28</a> Raptor Pose!"
2017-02-10T15:40:55Z,NOOOOOOO THE DOOR BINS... NOOOOOOO
2017-02-05T20:43:45Z,What a big sissy Brit!
2017-01-28T17:30:14Z,euro ncap rating of two!!!!!! .... and it might just spontanuesly combust like a Ford kuga
2017-01-26T09:22:36Z,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_6s-8Pagc&amp;t=5m34s"">5:34</a> easy way to fix that, drive on the correct side of the road lol."
2017-01-14T00:32:18Z,"I&#39;ve just driven this 5.0 litre V8 convertible in Florida for a week. It is sensational, but being typical American car, it is not as refined as our German cousins &amp; clearly the build quality is not the same. However the engine roar is sweet and performance is incredible. It really does give you a grin then you plant your foot down. It&#39;s all about emotion! For the price it is incredible value. Go for the automatic. Don&#39;t bother with the smaller engine, go for the 5.0!"
2017-01-06T16:53:45Z,Why do the British models not have Sync 3 yet?
2017-01-02T13:35:28Z,well he said that the rear seats will be fine for me cause m a kid butt wait i 5ft 8inn no way
2016-12-21T17:02:12Z,embarrassing.  Alan partridge drives this ford.
2016-12-15T17:19:37Z,"I don&#39;t understand why Ford doen&#39;t give the customer the opportunity to choose higher quality if he doesn&#39;t has a problem with spending more money. The GT costs in germany around 50k they just could give things like leather packages etc. for 10k extra. I&#39;d say a lot of ppl would compare this to a 440i, S4 or CLA."
2016-12-09T06:25:27Z,"I&#39;m disappointed with Ford and this, in the US you can get this with the 5.0 V8... a bit softer than the fastback, but it&#39;s a proper V8. <br>PD: If this is a 2016 model why doesn&#39;t carry a sync 3 system on it? ü§î"
2016-12-05T18:03:37Z,Where could I save money on a new car ?
2016-12-03T13:47:14Z,2 bars of boost
2016-11-20T12:08:42Z,Ecoboost.. zzzz
2016-11-05T14:54:57Z,"+Carwow Something I&#39;ve noticed is that most American cars don&#39;t pass the big bottle door test. I think it&#39;s because in America, we don&#39;t sell many beverages in 1 liter bottles the way they are...... well anywhere else in the world. I think American car designers don&#39;t have the liter bottle in mind when they make the door bin. Just something I&#39;ve noticed and something you might mention next time you review an American car. <br>I love your videos! Keep it up!"
2016-11-02T18:21:13Z,"LOL!! when you get into the rear of the car Mat, it&#39;s like you held your breath for quite long..."
2016-11-02T01:40:25Z,looks absolutely ridiculous car
2016-11-01T01:28:25Z,"Toyota Corolla has been in production since 1966 but you don&#39;t see them bragging about it. In the real world, a new Corolla will probably outlast a Mustang."
2016-10-31T21:52:20Z,"Great job carwow. I was watching Matts reviews since his previous channel and joined carwow from the beginning. Guys you really get what it takes to make the show. Keep it up. Also you should do hot hatchbacks review and head to head. Golf R, Audi R3, Mercedes A45 AMG and BMW 1M"
2016-10-30T22:34:43Z,I always knew mustang was a piece of shit
2016-10-30T16:14:30Z,"That&#39;s not a 2017 model, it&#39;s SYNC 3 on 2017 cars not the SYNC 2 system fitted here."
2016-10-30T12:30:25Z,another entertaining car review by Matt!
2016-10-30T11:16:09Z,Matt you love the focus but the mustang is rubbish ??! also the 2.3 engine is great in the focus but rubbish in the mustang ??!! dude Wtf ? if it&#39;s not british it&#39;s rubbish or what ?
2016-10-30T09:28:25Z,I liked the little Boost joke :P
2016-10-29T11:44:18Z,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_6s-8Pagc&amp;t=5m46s"">5:46</a> üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2016-10-29T10:57:59Z,bottom line is rubbish car haha! gud review Matt
2016-10-28T23:45:14Z,THE AMERICANS STILL CAN&#39;T MAKE A GOOD CAR
2016-10-28T18:32:07Z,Our Matt loves a Boost!!!
2016-10-28T16:55:24Z,I hope matt didn&#39;t hit a crowd
2016-10-28T11:08:03Z,What an incredibly distorted review.
2016-10-28T09:27:08Z,I only come here to find out more about the roof of the porsche!!! come on Mat! spill the beans.
2016-10-28T07:59:13Z,I still love the car.
2016-10-28T07:58:26Z,Interiour looks as cheap as  japanese cars in the 90s <b>lol</b>
2016-10-28T07:43:17Z,"I never know if the &#39;thumbs up or thumbs down&#39; is for the REVIEW or the CAR...so thumbs up for review, thumbs down for car!"
2016-10-28T05:23:17Z,"Starts from ¬£35,000 and it has manual seats and cheap plastic?? Ha, I think I&#39;ll stick to my 3 series and my X5 thanks"
2016-10-28T04:12:28Z,"The V6 is a way better option than the 4 and desppite what Ford says, gas mileage should be around the same"
2016-10-28T04:07:52Z,Seeing a brit driving a mustang is like seeing a fellow yank drink a cup of tea. <br>It just seems odd
2016-10-28T03:25:51Z,Can we get more videos pf your personal 911?
2016-10-28T01:55:14Z,"Mat, the way you enter the back seat is hilarious. Just like how a raptor trying to get into it."
2016-10-28T01:30:43Z,Wow it can talk to dolphins
2016-10-27T22:45:11Z,that head rest but made me LOL so much. instant like
2016-10-27T21:35:29Z,ive sat in the back of a supra. feel my pain pls
2016-10-27T21:34:10Z,That looks like a real crowd pleaser
2016-10-27T21:30:18Z,TKMaxx car
2016-10-27T21:27:17Z,Eco boost ?
2016-10-27T21:17:11Z,All the boost bars haha
2016-10-27T21:10:36Z,looks cheap
2016-10-27T21:09:15Z,I don&#39;t know why I felt like grabbing a boost bar.
2016-10-27T20:14:13Z,"Looks a bit more practicable than the previous generation, in particular the boot opening.<br><br>Same shockingly poor build quality by the looks of things. I remember taking the previous gen down the Pacific Coast Highway, it was a brand new V6, but the wipers and air con both packed in after 1,000 miles."
2016-10-27T20:08:38Z,"It&#39;s so American, it&#39;s surprising a Big Mac holder isn&#39;t on the options list"
2016-10-27T19:18:08Z,Any mazdas coming soon?
2016-10-27T18:31:21Z,nice enough bloke Matt but the reviews are kind of irritating..
2016-10-27T17:54:55Z,look at that product placement boost bars
2016-10-27T16:39:36Z,the whole point of a mustang is that you&#39;re buying into the whole v8 American muscle car thing. so a 4cl makes zero sense
2016-10-27T16:31:37Z,"would only get the coupe model, however if your not loaded the ecoboost would still be a good option if you don&#39;t want to pay ¬£500 tax and funny enough the Americans are all for the ecoboost over the v8? (according to sales.)"
2016-10-27T16:31:12Z,"I happen to own an EcoBoost convertible and I¬†must disagree with¬†all the criticism. It&#39;s very easy to dismiss¬†the car simply¬†because it doesn&#39;t have the V8, but a V8 for daily use and commuting really doesn&#39;t make much sense¬†since I&#39;m¬†on a budget. The only issue with the EcoBoost is the sound which I&#39;m happy to give up for the improved fuel economy."
2016-10-27T16:13:42Z,The exposed wires going into the rearview mirror is an example of its poor quality.
2016-10-27T16:11:43Z,Nice Easter egg Mat üëçüèª
2016-10-27T15:48:50Z,"@ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_6s-8Pagc&amp;t=6m11s"">6:11</a> I guess it was bring your kids to work day eh?"
2016-10-27T15:47:37Z,I&#39;d have to get the non-convertible V8. You don&#39;t buy a Mustang for economy.
2016-10-27T15:36:09Z,Boost bar for EcoBoost? ;) car wow Easter eggs!
2016-10-27T15:20:36Z,"In the early 90s Ford done a mustang that has rear independent suspension,  but the &#39;purists&#39;  over in America hated it as it was slower on the drag strip. They was that vocal Ford went back to the old live axel for a 20+years"
2016-10-27T15:12:17Z,Lol Matt looked like a &quot;special@ T. rex getting in to the back seats üòÇ
2016-10-27T14:50:43Z,"It&#39;s a ford,  what did you expect?"
2016-10-27T14:46:38Z,please make a video on audi rs5
2016-10-27T14:43:18Z,Boooooost
2016-10-27T14:32:01Z,Matt: said nothing about it sloppy steering feel when turning around corners
2016-10-27T14:28:10Z,I hope Matt didn&#39;t run anyone over with that Mustang...
2016-10-27T14:17:14Z,Salty price for what you get in this...
2016-10-27T14:08:10Z,"Very cheap and poor quality, great looks, overall meh... reviews are becoming more entertaining keep up this work carwow, it&#39;s great seeing that lame &quot;now what do i think of the .......&quot; outro replaced with the &quot;consider it buy it thing&quot;"
2016-10-27T13:39:00Z,FYI That is not a 2017 Mustang.
2016-10-27T13:16:11Z,"Great with the new 4 point system - avoid, consider, shortlist and buy!"
2016-10-27T13:06:48Z,this looks like a cabin from 2004 citroen c3 wtf are you talking about matt? <br>looks like shit
2016-10-27T12:35:39Z,When will America sort their shit out with interior material quality?
2016-10-27T12:21:50Z,"Great little review as always, cracked up at the headrest dolphin part üòÉ"
2016-10-27T12:20:59Z,in terms of style it wins over a TT in spades!! my daughter has one in Texas (or had one) and it was impossible for a decent child seat...
2016-10-27T12:22:52Z,Hey Matt! I love your reviews! Really awesome jokes btw! :D<br>Could you do one about the Mazda CX 5? I&#39;d like to watch it from you with this new cool features on carwow...<br>Keep going like this and i&#39;ll never unsubscribe this channel!<br>Cheers!
2016-10-27T12:11:52Z,can u make all car cameras to record when u add storage and little software?<br> has any1 done it?
2016-10-27T12:07:43Z,Best reviews on YouTube! you&#39;re funny haha
2016-10-27T12:07:00Z,"I hate convertibles that have more than 2 seats, it&#39;s just something about those rear seats that disgust me"
2016-10-27T11:58:09Z,Matt u going bareback?
2016-10-27T11:52:41Z,"Before Mat says what engine he&#39;s reviewing, I&#39;m guessing a 2.3l EcoBoost.<br><br>My guess comes from the boost bars :D"
2016-10-27T11:49:25Z,Finally an honest review of this car!
2016-10-27T11:26:31Z,Rather hav an M4 or C63
2016-10-27T11:23:56Z,I think you need to make one longer video with all the space and practicality sections included. It makes it easier than going backwards and forwards through videos.<br><br>Just my opinion.
2016-10-27T11:22:35Z,This car interior quality is really bad... This car is not a good one.
2016-10-27T11:18:19Z,can&#39;t afford one but his reviews feel like I m driving one.
2016-10-27T11:08:21Z,EU?! Why do we get the Mustang with no LED running lights in the front and with larger side mirrors?!
2016-10-27T11:07:04Z,REALLY UGLY
2016-10-27T11:05:45Z,Love the comment &quot;OK Ford I will raise the Windows then&quot; brilliant
2016-10-27T11:01:55Z,Convertible Ecoboost Mustang? That&#39;s heresy.
2016-10-27T11:00:34Z,"Hey Mat, great work. lol on the dolphin joke.<br>Question though, when are you doing the American muscle comparison now that Chevy Camaro is in UK?"
2016-10-27T10:56:15Z,matt why is it an auto manual only
2016-10-27T10:53:28Z,How&#39;s your Porsche going? Fixed the roof? All good?
2016-10-27T10:53:26Z,ecoBoost bar.
2016-10-27T10:53:17Z,Internet fixed!
2016-10-27T10:52:57Z,"You&#39;ve done the new BMW 7 Series review, new Mercedes S Class review and the new Audi A8 review. Any chance of doing the new Jaguar XJ?"
2016-10-27T10:48:26Z,Yo matt. I like the boost choc Easter egg! Haha
2016-10-27T10:47:19Z,gay
2016-10-27T10:41:35Z,I don&#39;t understand the mpg. The higher is better ?
2016-10-27T10:40:57Z,good video
2016-10-27T10:37:48Z,321st
2016-10-27T10:33:28Z,Nice review.
2016-10-27T10:32:07Z,I now want a boost bar for some odd reason...
2016-10-27T10:29:18Z,Will Matt respond?<br>Great video as always
2016-10-27T10:29:00Z,How many more convertable reviews?
2016-10-27T10:28:56Z,Oh yes!
2016-10-27T10:25:32Z,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_6s-8Pagc&amp;t=6m42s"">6:42</a> Some say Mat resides in that forest in between car reviews. Carwow just park a new car in front of the treeline as bait and he emerges."
